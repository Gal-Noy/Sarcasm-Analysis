The flaps, like most flap books, are not going to hold up to her pulling on them, but overall it is a very good quality book for the type of book that it is. I've been able to easily repair lift up flaps with clear tape, and it's fine. As with all books for young kids, some wear and tear is to be expected, but this book has flaps of good quality so it can handle the repeat fixings.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 0

After I removed the peel from the banana, the slicer worked quite well.I like to carry my bananas around in my front pants pocket.  Before I purchased this product, I used to get a lot of "is that a banana in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" jokes.  Not anymore!  The banana slices fit comfortably in my front (and back) pockets, and now my life is embarrassment-free.

Its bright yellow color makes it a novelty item and, as such, a natural conversation piece. I hoped it would brighten the mood of my home, and it did--at first.I noticed that the frequency of visitations to my home by friends and relatives spiked rapidly. Within a week, I counted some thirty unique visitors, some of whom I had never seen before. Within a month, though I am a naturally introspective man and prefer a quiet life, I was having parties on an almost nightly basis and masses of people were circulating through my home at all hours of the night.I also found myself eating more bananas. I purchased a full bunch and found that the H571 made preparing them a breeze. I put them in cereal for breakfast, salads for lunch, and banana bread for dinner. I put bananas in buns with ketchup, relish, cheddar cheese, and chili. I also marinated bananas in teriyaki sauce and grilled them with rice and shrimp. I couldn't get enough.While I was at the grocery store purchasing more bananas for my H571, I noticed a strong, hunchbacked man glaring at me. He tried to be inconspicuous by testing the firmness of tomatoes and looking away every time I gazed in his direction, but no matter how many times he looked away, his eyes kept wandering back to me.I thought nothing of it until I saw the same man in a suit, following me in town a few days later. Then I was spooked. I walked fast and he walked fast. I ran and he ran. I ducked into a tattoo parlor and he followed me in. It was a small shop, and with my luck no one was up front, waiting for prospective clients. The hunchbacked man came into the store and pointed what felt like a banana into my back."There's something you need to know about your H571," he said."How did you know?" I said.He said no more. He turned me around and gave me a shove out the door. A black sedan was waiting on the street. The door opened and two more hunchbacks were inside. I noticed they all had the number 17 tattooed on their wrist. We drove to what appeared to be an abandoned armory building in a neglected district downtown.The hunchbacks escorted me toward the building, warning me not to dare make a sound.I was almost inside when, in a blinding yellow flash, my H571 boomeranged into my hand. It was glowing and no longer felt like plastic. It was supple and fluidly extended when I flicked it to the left or right.The hunchbacks were suddenly afraid of me. They kept their distance as I backed away toward the street.A yellow cab came by and I got in.As I drove away, the hunchbacks pleaded with me that I had much to learn about the power I possessed with the H571, and that they could teach me. But how could I trust them?When I looked down, my H571 had returned to its normal plastic state and I haven't been able to trigger its bizarre properties since.I'm glad I purchased the H571--I now believe it is much more than a banana slicer--and I hope to report on its exact nature in more detail as my understanding of it grows.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

That's when the fun began.  There was a piece of paper in the packaging, but it appeared to be just the packing slip.  There was not a trace of instructions to be found anywhere!  We must have stared at that packing list for an hour, passing it back and forth between us, convinced there were instruction on how to use the dang thing somewhere.  Eventually we gave up and had to learn to use it with trial and error.What a mess that was.  I will let you all in on what we learned:DO NOT try to stand the banana on end and slice it that way.  The stem will get stuck between the blades.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and slice the stem off before using the tool.DO peel the banana first.  The blades are made of plastic and an unpeeled banana (especially a unripe one) will be horrific to try to slice with this tool.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and score the banana peel lengthwise four times, rotating the banana as you do.DO NOT buy bananas in bunches at the grocery store. You need to buy them singly.  This is because ONLY HALF THE BANANAS IN THE STORE FIT IN THIS DAMN THING!  Look closely at the product picture; you will need to buy bananas that "face" to the right.  Ones that face left won't fit.  And make sure you lay them out in your shopping cart that way carefully; we have gotten home and realized that we thought we had purchased all "righties" but had a few "lefties" when we unloaded our groceries.  If you must try a "leftie", I suggest you get a knife and cut the banana in thirds, and then flip the top and bottom parts over so that the outcast banana appears to be a "rightie".Hope this helps!::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

There will soon be a Benzali 7000 Banana Slicer that will slice two banana at the same time resulting in 36 perfectly formed slices. Yes, as impossible as this seems, Benzali has found a way to double your banana slicing pleasure by halving the time to slice two bananas. Even more impossible sounding is that it will also work with just one banana meaning you will only need a single device to cut either 1 or 2 bananas.I have seen the new device and took a picture but was caught by Benzali Security who took my camera and locked me in a room. I crawled through a ventilation duct and slid outside and swore I would let the public know what is about to transpire. I now travel in the dark of night with a cyanide tablet at the ready for I know if Benzali ever finds me the torture I would be subjected to is worse than death itself. Fortunately, the cyanide is banana flavored and I will leave this earthly plane with a smile upon my face.Stay strong banana lovers and wait for your chance to buy the perfect device.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

It doesn't slice the flake type of cereal at all well and you may as well forget about "in bowl" slicing altogether.

I simply wanted an easier way to slice bananas for my kids in the morning. I was sick and tired of the horrific hours spent painstakIngly slicing bananas one coin at a time.When I saw this banana slicer on Amazon, it was like the heavens above opened and angels began to sing. I had to have it.I ordered it and set up a tent next to my mailbox so it wouldn't fall into the wrong hands. A tool this powerful has to be guarded at all times. 3 to 5 days later, it arrived.The anticipation was almost too much to handle as I ripped open the nondescript cardboard box. There it was, the tool that would change my life for the better.I nervously peeled the first banana of the morning, not knowing whether to be scared or exhilarated. I placed the banana cutter over the banana and started pressing down, gently at first, then harder and harder as my confidence improved in leaps and bounds. Just like that, I was through the banana. I let out a little gasp. It had felt so good!I quickly peeled another banana and sliced right through it. Then I sliced another . . . Then another. Soon all the bananas in the house were sliced, but I wasn't ready to stop. I had to slice more bananas. I went to the store, intent on buying a couple bananas to fuel my new addiction. When I saw all those bananas, I couldn't control myself. I started opening them and slIcing them right there in the store.Needless to say, I was asked to leave by a clerk who gave me a knowing look and muttered "banana slicer got another one" as he ushered me out the door. I rushed to the fruit stand and bought every banana they had. When my fiancé got home work, he found me frantically searching through a large pile of banana peels in hope is missed a banana.I gave this banana slicer 5 stars because it works as advertised. Actually, it works too well. I'm writing this review from the library in Ithica State Prison because I was caught in a neighbors house slicing bananas. Use it at your own risk.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

That's why I'm delighted to endorse the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!  I've yet to find a type it couldn't slice with ease.  The Hutzler performed beautifully on the fruit I bought in Cuba (the Havana banana), the banana from Georgia (the Savannah banana), and the sucker I bought in Missoula from a washed-up teen idol (the Hanna Montana banana).  It provided uniform slices when used on the petrified specimen from Ricky Ricardo's old nightclub (the Tropicana banana), as well as fruit grown in the flood plain of the serpentine Pennsylvania river (the Susquehanna banana).  Say goodbye to blisters caused by slicing fruit now that the Hutzler 571 is available from Amazon (with a doctor's prescription).  All I can say is, this is a great time to be alive and be slicing bananas!::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

Banana trees are remarkably resistant to nuclear radiation as well as the shrieks of the dying and dead. The banana is the perfect fruit.

The banana is the only fruit that will. Not even a mango. Nope, not even a coconut.In the post-apoc, I'll have a banana bandolier for sustenance, zombie ammo, to trade for sex and gasoline, and critical to all of this is the high speed and low drag Hutzler 571 Banana slicer. In the Hell Age of Mankind, we will eat fast and we will eat on the run. No time for slicing one at a time. This is a full auto slicer. This is the rat-a-tat-tat of life on a dead planet.And there will be things, unspeakable things, sliced with this tactical beast of slice that I cannot write in this review. But food will be had. And enemies will perish.I'm buying 100 of these and burying them in ammo cans around the Pacific NW. I'm ready for the end.

I purchase about 20-25 pounds of bananas at a time for dehydration. Before purchasing the banana slicer, I just cut the bananas with a butter knife.  My slices would not all be the same thickness and would not dehydrate in the same amount of time. The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner. I prefer 1/4" slices for dehydrated bananas and these are about 1/2" thick.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

So whenever I'm hanging above a vat of acid thinking of an escape plan or growling at a middle man to give me the name of his boss, I can enjoy a quick bite of banana bliss.

Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my "good eater" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his "gratitude" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing "dangerously high levels of potassium" and "lacking in any other necessary nutrients".  This product, which initially improved my life, has torn my family apart.  I should add however, I don't blame the product I blame my family.  They are bunch of ingrates with weak stomachs.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

I was able to download the "Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)." It is 349mb so it took a while to download, but I was able to save it on my desktop for easy locating. I was then able to work with the fruit department tech team and jotted down some notes.Instructions:1) Go to the "start" menu and search for "config.sys" file.2) In a SEPARATE search window, manually browse your desktop for the "Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)"3) Double click the patch file icon, when it opens, click "disable autorun," then close the file.4) Going back to the patch file icon, RIGHT CLICK the icon and select "open with"5) Open with the notepad application.6) Scroll to line 371 and highlight lines 371 - 1114. Right mouse click and select "Copy"7) Going back to config.sys file opened in step 1, open in "basic editor."8) When the configuration file opens, disable (ignore button) the two warning screens that pop up.9) Scroll to line 22453, and type (rem) in front of the first semicolon BUT BEFORE the \\ signs. (This is CRITICAL as this line must be remmed out for the 571b to perform the "fruit alignment" rendering procedure required on all Hutzler banana slicers since the release of the Hutzler 300 series banana slicer. (EXCEPT 314a-d and any of the "M300" series military use field banana slicing units.)10) Scroll to line 14234, add a line and hit paste; this will add lines 371 - 1114 of the patch code.11) Hit close, then "save edits."12) Re-open the patch file icon. Enable autorun. Close patch file.13) Re-open the patch file.14) After 20 or 30 seconds (while autorunning) a message window will appear with the message "Hutzler 571b now installed."15) Select "set default actions".16) Click "autodetect left/right fruit polarity" (this will be a HUGE timesaver later, allowing for left/right handed fruit processing WITHOUT having to purchase the Hutzler 571C or utilizing the rug-drop technique mentioned in previous reviews.(FINALLY!!!!))17) Click "enable onboard camera use"; when the yellow warning window opens click "allow." (You may have to disable any Norton software you have running at this point and retry; check the YouTube video.)18) Click "save autodetect state", then click save configuration state. (You can create a backup file at this point if you wish, I recommend this if you are planning to clone this drive or migrate this file to additional 571b banana slicing machines.)19) Re-boot machine.Its just that simple! You are now ready to use your Hutzler 571B banana slicer on a Windows 8 platform for both left and right hand polarity bananas! ENJOY!Note: The above instructions are intended for use on 64bit machines only!

You see, I... am a slice addict. As you will see, I was among the greatest and most profligate banana slicers in the world. My slicing was legendary. I sliced with John Belushi, Lindsay Lohan, R Kelly, George "Cowboy Banana Cowboy" Bush, Barack "Slicedaddy" Obama, Keith Richards-I once sliced with Chris Farley for 60 hours straight. I was living the high life, until it all came crashing down around me.You see, for years, I was lost in a morass of banana-slicing impotence, aimlessly wandering through life obsessed with finding the perfect banana-slicing instrument. A simple google search yields thousands of competent and admirable banana-slicing products and methods, or b-slizzle as we slice addicts call it, but none measured up to my expectations of banana-slicing grace. I was a substance addict, my tonic being a soft, smooth, perfect banana slice. At first, it was a simple hobby. Like most of you, I would spend no more than five or six hours a day slicing, displaying, posting on facebook, and then consuming. Of course it's probably obvious to most of you now that for those of us with the sliceaholic gene, this level of slicing is not near enough to satiate our desires and can only end up in disaster. But being a true addict, I was blind to the pain I was causing others and deaf to the warnings of friends, family and activists. I ended up hurting those who love me the most: kids, grandkids, wives, parents, and my pet hedgehogs. It got to the point where I would stay awake for days straight pushing my bananas through the strings of my guitar and then shaking them out of the hole or shoving bananas through the chicken wire surrounding my hedgehogs. But the banana slices, magnificent as they were, would inevitably end up getting eaten by the hedgehogs or tasting like guitar. From there I began to explore new and dangerous slice methods-methods that would connect me to both the glamorous side of b-slizzling and the deadly underworld of slice addicts.A typical day for me would begin at the banana factory, trading sex or drugs or cash for a fresh batch of newly-minted bananas. Green, yellow, brown-it mattered not. It was all about the slice for me, as any slice addict can attest. From there I would cruise the whittling district with nothing but a knapsack or barrel full of bananas and a bowie knife, selling my flesh to knife artisans for their crafting of slices. But still, the bananas were sliced only to near-perfection, leaving me craving more and better slice every time. I had already been kicked out of every Japanese restaurant from Houston to Chicago for throwing bananas at the chefs to cut in the air. In my insatiable lust for the smooth sensuality of fresh banana slices, I was blind to the racial insensitivity of this practice. I cannot even begin to count the number of kids around town whose bicycles I stole, just to feed my lust for the reckless and dangerous practice of spoke-slicing, or "splicing" as we call it.As I found newer, more efficient-and often ruthless-slizz techniques, I became more and more careless and violent, but still, it was ever enough. I was arrested at home furnishing stores for pushing thousands of bananas through their window blind displays (blindspotting). I was walking around day and night wearing nothing but multi-blade ice skates just to slice the thousands of bananas littering the floor of my home and yard at any given time (figureslicing). I can't tell you how many poor hedgehogs I killed or maimed because of those shoes. I wasted tens of thousands of dollars on designer grade electric and solar-powered fans with razor-sharp blades to accommodate the immense volume of slicing I was pushing on a daily basis (blowing). I always tried to use solar fans to reduce my carbon footprint.Of course this enslaving lifestyle could not be sustained forever. My picture was on the wall of every Benihana in the southwest. Children all over the state had replaced their traditional spoked wheels with solid spokes, and the motocross bullies would turn their bikes on me and beat me senseless when I would stand alongside the supercross track shoving b into their frenzied wheel-spinning (motoring). On October 3rd, 2007, I had hit rock bottom. I had just slizzed with Sean and Biggie in the Hamptons (he's still alive, turning tricks for b in the banana underworld). I awoke from a potassium coma to find my bank account, formerly over twenty million dollars, completely dry. Everybody talked about the housing and equities markets crashing, but let me tell you, the crisis hit the slicers bad!. My credit cards were all cut off, and my lines of credit with the banks and various banana slicing venture capitalists were dry. And the hedgehogs had revolted in a bloody uprising, known as The Bloody Hedgehog Uprising.As I write to you today, from the comfort of my humble country cottage, I do so giving grace to god, with sorrow and gratitude to those whose lives I crushed and those who stood by me through all the finger cuts and slipping on peels. I have found a tranquil peace, all thanks to the hundreds of amazing, beautiful people who made the H-5 a reality.I will skip the platitudes so pervasive in all the reviews of this magnificent product and cut to the chase. CUT TO THE CHASE. That's what the H-5 does. I call it the H-5 for short and because H-5 sounds almost as awesome as the H-5 is. Who knew that I could find peace from such a complex, yet simple, engineering marvel. You would think that I would have had to walk away cold-turkey, but for me, the game was all about the perfect slice. You see, once you find the perfect slice, your life is at peace. And that is what I have found-what I find every day-the perfect slice. Although my H-5 background check revealed to many illicit banana incidents in the past to procure one legally, I was able to receive a presidential pardon from George Bush because he knows I could blow the whistle on his falsified reports on Saddam's WMB's (Wildly Massive B-Slicers) and from Barack Obama because of the help I offered in getting Obamaslice to the socialists.So kids, understand that banana slicing is not as glamorous as all those billboards in the 70s portrayed it, and can be done in a safe and fun manner from your own home for under five dollars. I sincerely hope that the scientists and board members of Hutzler continue forward and attack similar cancers on humanity like methamphetamines, aids and immigration. So much gratitude goes to Anthony Weiner for bringing bananas into the public eye and to Fox News for having the conviction to doggedly pursue this story in hopes of bringing down the banana-controlled senate. May you all experience the joy and frivolity of the H-571. Peace and love to all.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

Since I was a 8 year old in Morocco I had two dreams, a banana slicer and a banana straightener. Unfortunately the latter has still not yet been invented. But, lets go to the point of my situation. The banana slicer clearly depicts a Pale Banana PANTONE 12-0824 TPX color, the one I received is a Banana Crepe PANTONE 13-0815 and it is simply unacceptable. No refunds, no explanation, Stacey passed my call to "Rori" (what in the name of bananas is that name?) and he still did not solve issue nor was able to explain why we have this banana tone divergence. Word of caution for you shopper: Pale Banana will not solve your issues. Shipped it back even without a refund.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

Fortunately, or not, during my second purchase I had the foresight to consider what other essential "upgrades" I need just to make use of the original product.Let's just say that it all works beautifully, the banana scouring powder and polishing cloth, the peeler, the slicer, and the 13-head-rotating-banana-slicer-scrub-brush all deliver as promised, but I hope the excitement of flawless bananas on the kids' Christmas morning Cheerios is present enough from Santa this year. In fairness, the banana de-threader and banana seed extractor were probably unnecessary luxuries. But then again, were they? It's not as though I splurged on the titanium and redwood display case. (Honestly, at a quarter the price, the stainless steel and artisan-selected oak gets the job done without being unnecessarily ostentatious.)Part of me feels like we could have made due with just a cigar cutter, the appropriate violin strings, 1.25" and 3.75" duct tape, a repurposed loom and/or the spokes from the front wheel of a brass unicycle, a yard of bacteria-resistant crushed velvet, a baker's dozen of My Little Pony mane and tailbrushes, a set of resurfaced wooden dominoes, a pair of needle-nosed surgical-grade tweezers, and a well-trained midget. But hell, it was just one Christmas... unless the rumors about the upcoming release of Hutzer's Miracle Banana Spot Remover turn out to be true. The kids will understand.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

The 569 would leave stringy banana "veins" all over the bars. The 570 would cause the banana slices to turn brown and the kids would scream and cry when I tried to get them to eat them. The 571's Siri feature is very helpful when needing information on the history of the banana and import/export laws. The 571 also takes panoramic photos of the banana prior to slicing. I'm so glad I stood in line to upgrade. The 571 is everything they said it would be and more.

That's what I thought I was getting when my husband and I moved from our home in California to chilly, dim Belmont, Maine. An ideal place to raise the kids -- Josie, 16, and Matthew, 9 -- and friendly neighbors to make every day of our small-town life worth waking up to.Alas. We purchased our spacious new home in optimistic disregard of the warnings of the townsfolk. These small towns! So superstitious! No grizzled old crone with a voice like a rusted iron gate screaming in agony is going to tell ME how to live MY life -- am I right, folks? The house was cheap, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Nothing could go wrong! Well, perhaps the skeletons of small animals we kept finding around the house should have been a clue. Perhaps the weather, which had a tendency to change from bright and sunny to horribly overcast in moments, should have made us think something was up. Perhaps even the sound of screaming in the attic, which yielded only odd scratch marks on the walls when investigated, should have tipped us off. But it didn't.In one of the kitchen drawers of our lovely home we discovered an item which I believe to be a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. My husband was overjoyed! Finally, a device which perfectly accommodated his banana-slicing needs, apparently left behind by the house's former tenants. Let me tell you, there was a reason it was left behind. Despite my reservations, I agreed to give the banana slicer a shot. It worked very well, and sliced bananas with an efficiency yet unknown to man -- and which I believe should remain unknown.A few weeks after he started using the banana slicer, my husband noticed that he was having trouble sleeping at night. The bedroom grew deathly cold, and the plumbing rattled like it was possessed. My husband complained of terrible dreams, in which giant bananas beckoned to him from the darkest corners of his mind. I begged him to stop using the banana slicer, but he ignored me, insisting it was simply the stress of his new job. I wish I had pursued the matter, but instead I dropped it, agreeing that he was probably right. I was just being silly.When the children began to come to me with marks on their backs and arms in the shape of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I knew something had to be done, before it was too late. While my husband was out one day, I threw the banana slicer into the nearby lake. However, due to its plastic composition, it quickly floated back to shore. More serious measures had to be taken. I put the banana slicer into a box, which I then nailed shut, put into another box, shut that box with chains, and buried it in the woods 20 miles from our home. My husband would be none the wiser, I thought, and we would just have to deal with the lack of convenient banana slicing in our lives. However, when I arrived home, there was the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, in my husband's hands. When he asked me where I had been, I couldn't respond. I did not truly know terror until that moment.My terror only increased when my husband began to show signs of hostility, as if the banana slicer was influencing him in some way. He was no longer the nondescript middle-class dark-haired white male I knew. Instead, he snapped at me. He refused to speak to the children. One day, he shoved me. At that point, I knew I had lost him. However, I didn't anticipate what would come next.Months later, my life was hell. I hadn't been sleeping properly. I could hardly eat, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the kitchen at all times. The children had noticed my lethargy, and seemed afraid to be alone in the house with their father. As it turned out, they were right to be afraid. My husband, influenced by the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, flew into a murderous rage, and would have killed us all had I not stopped him... with the knife I had been using to prepare a butternut squash for dinner.These days, my mother has custody of the children. I have been spending my time recovering -- and hunting for the source of the evil that I now know to be the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I've finally found it. Now, its undoing can begin, and I will finally have my life back...::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

In addition to slicing bananas, it could be used to prepare that nasty bully beef loaf in our rations.I can picture it clearly, as if it were just yesterday...There we were, anxiously waiting in the rain and mud for the signal to advance into no man's land.  Through the coils of barbed wire and across the field pocked with water-filled shell holes, we could barely see our objective - the enemy trenches.  Up and down the line, the order was relayed: "Fix....Hutzlers!"  Almost as one, we snapped our slicers onto the lugs below the barrels of our Enfields, and waited.  That was the worst time...waiting...some of us praying.There! The sound of the whistles and we were over the top, scrambling like rats to get through the wire and across that wretched field!  Somewhere off to the left a Maxim started chattering, and soon it was joined by the distinctive snap of Mannlicher rounds.  On we ran, fighting the muddy footing, cursing, screaming, slipping, closing...always closing...and then we were on them!Words cannot describe the effect our Hutzlers had upon the Hun.  I...I cannot speak of it plainly, even today, for it brings a cold pain to my chest.  See? Now my hands are trembling to think of that day...the look on their faces. But, for those of us who survived the crossing, the Huntzler proved to be the turning point, the edge that broke the stalemate along the front and ultimately led to the Armistice.There are few of us left today who remember that time.  We gather once a year to reminisce and perform a toast to those comrades who paid the ultimate price.  And we toast the Hutzler, for without it I am certain we all would have stayed in that god-forsaken muddy hell until it became our common grave.::entityRecognition for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

Clients were as rare as hens teeth, these days.  It seemed word got out that I was getting sloppy. "Mr banana fingers", they called me behind my back.  "He's losing his touch", they'ed whisper.  But when you've sliced as many as i have you'd get soft too.  Fat chance I was retiring now. Not with a '57 convertible half way paid off and a tab at the banana stand on 4th that was well past its shelf life. I was a one punch palooka half way to loserville, smelling like cheap cologne and broken dreams.But then she walked in.  She was a knock out.  the kind of girl that made old men suck in their gut and young men puff out their chest.  "We'll hello there sweetheart, the dentist office is next door", I said with a smile."I'm not looking for the dentist", she said.  "I'm looking for Johnny Flynn Private Slicer.""We'll you came to the right place", I said, mustering up what I hoped was a look of confidence.  "Tell me what's on your mind."The story she told would have turned the most jaded slicer green with banana envy.  It was a big job.  The biggest. And even though my gut was turning somersaults I knew I couldn't turn it down.  This was the kind of slicing gig that would make a hundred reputations or destroy a thousand more.Her father was the head of the Dole banana conglomerate and some Ivy League poindexter came up with the big idea to do the annual customer gala with a casino night theme.  But this time they were gunna use banana chips instead of poker chips.  These babies had to be stripped, sliced and dried to exact measurements if they were going to be handled by Dole's biggest clients."I heard you're the best", she said."Was the best", I thought.  "Yeah, I've still got the chops. Watch this. I grabbed my number 7 knife and threw a banana in the air. I swung at it and missed it entirely.  My knife stabbed down through nothin' but air and dropped out of my hand on the table in front of me.  I watched the banana spin slowly as it fell fell fell and slap, like some miracle you read about in those dime store slicer mags, the banana landed on the knife blade and was cut cleanly in two.  My jaw dropped open in amazement and my eyes were big as saucers."Impressive", she said."Impossible", I thought.  "Yep, impressive is my middle name.", I stammered.She tossed her red hair back and said, "You got the job. See you Saturday at eight.""B... Buh... but, we haven't talked about my fee.She laughed and said as she walked to the door, "Whatever your usual fee is, I'll pay triple."Then she added, "Oh, and if you blow this gig you'll never work in this town again."And with a slam of the door she was gone.  I realized then she hadn't told me her name. That didn't matter.  Everyone knew who she was. It was splashed across the society pages every week.  "Dole diva doles out dollars to the down and despondent" or "Lecherous love lorn Lothario leaves Linda Livingston livid".  L. & L. but friends just called her Elle."You'll never work in this town again".Those words echoed over and over in my head.  As I reached for my hat my hand was shaking.  But then, I looked down at the table and saw the miracle banana perfectly sliced.... an accident, or was it?  Maybe the big guy up stairs was gunna save my sorry heiner once again.  I said a quick thanks to my guardian slicer and headed home.  Once I got in bed doubt crashed into my head like a 500 lb gorilla on a sack of Dole's finest.  I wasn't gunna come out of this.  Not ol' Banana Fingers.  I needed help fast and I knew just where to get it.  Johnny Flynns mentor in this business was a crusty old slicer named Harvey Muldoon.  Long retired he learned the trade over seas cooking banana fritters and stew for the yanks during WWI.  If anyone could help me pull this off it was him.  I know it was late but I went over and told him everything--about the dame, the gig and the banana trick.  He sat their stone faced until I told him about the banana flip, miss and slice.  If it wasn't so late in the evening I would swear he shed a tiny tear.  He got up from his chair and stood there. And with a smile he said, "I guess you're going to be needing this."  He dragged the paint chipped chair over to the corner of the room, got up on it.  Reaching up to the ceiling he pushed at a plank which moved out of the way.  He reached into the ceiling compartment and pulled out a box wrapped in an old World War I army issue banana sack.  Inside was a battered tin box.  With a look of immense pride he handed it to me like a father handing someone their new born to hold for the first time.  "This saved my life", he said as he carefully lifted the dented metal lid.  Inside was a hand cut form made of velvet and soft cotton and nestled in the middle was a strange looking device. Reverently he took it out and handed it to me.  "Be careful now.  It's razor sharp.""What is it" I said.It's the Hutzler 571.  It's what gave me the speed and precision to feed thousands of doughboys a day with mess tins and steaming bowls of banana fritters, pudding and stew.I was intrigued but skeptical... until I saw it in action.  Shazam! It sliced bananas faster than Ricky Ricardo could smack a conga drum."I will take good care of it", I said solemnly."You better. It's yours now.", he said.I was overwhelmed. "I don't know what to say.""You can start with a simple thank you" he said with a smirk.Come Saturday I was all ready.  I made a small leather holster for it so that I could pull it out at a moments notice.  I practiced my draw in front of the mirror day and night.  I can't say that the event went perfectly.  But I got the satisfaction of Elle saying I could slice her bananas any old time of the year.I found my confidence that day.  Thanks to some divine help and an old man's secret weapon I made it to the big banana leagues.  No more scraping around for the odd job. Now I named my fee and sliced my way across the banana circuit.  But still, with my fame and banana jet set status Linda Livingston was still out of my league.  Now when I read about her in the society section I save the article and place them in a folder in the large steel safe along with a battered tin box. When I see it I say a quick thanks to her for walking into my life and giving this old flatfoot a chance to start again.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

You see, my grandmother died 17 years ago.  For at least 20 years prior to her death, my grandma ate Corn Flakes with sliced bananas on it for breakfast every single morning.  On her deathbed, she grabbed my hand and said "Barbara, if only....if only I hadn't had to slice those bananas every morning, I could have had a few more years!  Slicing those darn bananas took years off my life!  You--my brilliant granddaughter--you must invent something that will slice the bananas so as to give other seniors a few more years--years I wish I still had!  You must do it!"Well, as I am still grieving the loss of my grandmother, I have been unable to work on inventing something to slice bananas.  Imagine my surprise to find that it had been invented--thus saving me the time-consuming process of designing, engineering, acquiring a patent, all of that stuff. Thank you Hutzler!I have ordered two cases of these wonderful items.  My parents will now have more time left...time they won't have to spend slicing bananas over their cereal.  I plan on ordering more of them to take to the senior villages around here and distributing them (I live in Florida, we have an overabundance or seniors down here).  Once I get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the hands of every senior citizen in Florida, I will work on younger populations.  This product could, conceivably, add years to the average persons' lifespan.  It could also result in more money in Hutzler's pocket, as I am sure once folks start using the right-handed slicer, they will want to order the left-handed slicer.For years I have been searching for my mission in life.  Distributing the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to senior citizens, I now believe, is my calling.

You see, my grandmother died 17 years ago.  For at least 20 years prior to her death, my grandma ate Corn Flakes with sliced bananas on it for breakfast every single morning.  On her deathbed, she grabbed my hand and said "Barbara, if only....if only I hadn't had to slice those bananas every morning, I could have had a few more years!  Slicing those darn bananas took years off my life!  You--my brilliant granddaughter--you must invent something that will slice the bananas so as to give other seniors a few more years--years I wish I still had!  You must do it!"Well, as I am still grieving the loss of my grandmother, I have been unable to work on inventing something to slice bananas.  Imagine my surprise to find that it had been invented--thus saving me the time-consuming process of designing, engineering, acquiring a patent, all of that stuff. Thank you Hutzler!I have ordered two cases of these wonderful items.  My parents will now have more time left...time they won't have to spend slicing bananas over their cereal.  I plan on ordering more of them to take to the senior villages around here and distributing them (I live in Florida, we have an overabundance or seniors down here).  Once I get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the hands of every senior citizen in Florida, I will work on younger populations.  This product could, conceivably, add years to the average persons' lifespan.  It could also result in more money in Hutzler's pocket, as I am sure once folks start using the right-handed slicer, they will want to order the left-handed slicer.For years I have been searching for my mission in life.  Distributing the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to senior citizens, I now believe, is my calling.  If I can save even ONE grandchild the grief I have experienced at my grandmother losing years--YEARS!!--of her life due to having to slice bananas then it will be worthwhile.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1

At least, not since I purchased this handy-dandy slicer when I saw it on special for under $3 including s/h.Nowadays, as soon as I see a few brown spots, I just zip off the peel, press this nifty tool over the banana, and freeze my sliced bananas for use in smoothies, cereals, what-have-you.  And, it's easy to remove the slices too ... sometimes, I can hold it on both ends and wiggle and the banana slices will just fall out. For the stubborn ones, just a light tap slicer end(s) on a hard surface, and out they pop.The slicer is HUGE, by the way, and might work even on plantains(???).  On the small-average sized banana, it takes a little maneuvering to place the huge cutter, and some slices will come out quite angled while the others will be uniformly rounded.  No matter, a slice is a slice, is a slice.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId b092634e1b73a94c for inputIndex 1
