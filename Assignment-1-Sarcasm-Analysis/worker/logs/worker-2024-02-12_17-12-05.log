I only purchased it just for the very sole purpose of being able to write a review. Besides being the coolest white elephant gift giver, I also became quickly known to my townspeople as 'the Woman who slices perfect bananas.' Its a very well respected skill in my town.This product also has helped me eat more bananas, shop for bananas every 3 days to keep them in the perfect stages of ripeness and the shape for my tool which in turn gave me purpose in life. I also gained a few pounds with the extra sugar and it seemed to go to my booty , so this product is also a booty enhancer, wow, who knew?My experimentation in bananas has lead me to make banana fosters and that has brandy in it to flambé' so I also keep brandy in my house and that makes me warm and happy too. I like bananas and liquor. I like to use my slicer in the mid morning when the sun is just peeking Into my kitchen windows ,after my coffee ,before my lunch....I peel a banana, slice it in one easy push down of the tool, then I think...self? what should I do with these even, yellow slices? Then I brainstorm ways to use the slices in sandwiches, smoothies, rice cakes, on toast, in cereal,in oats, in my foster or in the freezer for later days. It's endless.I don't have a pet monkey but this slicer has opened my mind to the idea.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

It seems her unborn baby was craving a banana for breakfast.  Unfortunately, the expectant mother was experiencing pregnancy induced carpal tunnel in her right hand which rendered the hand absolutely useless (in a related side note, she also specifically refers to this uncontrollable hand as “The Claw!” from the movie Liar Liar).  How was she supposed to cut and eat this banana the Claw she wondered?  So began the process of trial and error.  The banana was ripe, so she was able to “claw” the fruit and bash it on the edge of the counter to get the peel to break open.  But then she dropped it on the kitchen floor on account of useless Claw, but was able to pick it up with her left hand.  After it was skinned, she attempted to use a steak knife (that she stole from a nearby five star steakhouse) with her left hand to slice it into equal 1/4” wide slices.  But her luck just couldn't improve—it was a right-handed knife! Being in a bit of an exhausted rage, she threw the banana into the a Magic Bullet and made a banana mash.  According to the mother, that’s not what the baby ordered!  I gave her the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer product the day after the incident (Amazon Prime Free Two-Day Shipping delivered in only one day!) and it solved all of her life’s problems.  The mother and baby lived happily ever after!::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

First that was good, but now it was bad. Allow me to explain. I recently brought the Hutzler on a flight to the East Coast. As I began slicing bananas for my own superb in-flight meal, the kid next to me got so excited he started yelling like crazy (of course, many children have this reaction when seeing it for the first time, we all know that). This got the attention of some other passengers and then a flight attendant. Upon viewing the Hutzler Handiwork (as I call it), the lame flight attendant yelled out "BANANA TERRORIST! BANANA TERRORIST!" Three rows up an Air Marshall leapt from his seat, witnessed my miracle food, and promptly shot me to death.  So I post this review posthumously, from heaven, where I sadly report... there are no bananas. I did leave Hutzlers to each of my 12  children and their 5 mothers though, so my life is in order.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

LOCAL 2024-02-12 17:12:42 INFO  Worker:57 - Received task: 9a5176f86197315e::2::R47HAWHHDXE5D::It all started innocently enough in high school.  Some people thought little Billy Epstein and I were gay, but we really took Home Ec class because that was where all the chicks were.  We learned a lot in that class - about life, our sexuality, pubescent females and food prep.  Our teacher, Ed Banapeel, was very competitive.  We sliced and we diced into all hours of the night practicing and hoping that we could all get full-ride scholarships to culinary schools.  Banapeel was certain that would elevate his program higher than the football and basketball programs combined.  He needed to find a competitive edge and one day found it on Amazon - the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It was faster than anything we had seen before, and clean-up was a breeze.  However, the Hutzler 571 is so much more.Being adolescent males, we decided to sneak a Hutzler 571 out of the school to spend more time with it and realize its full potential.  We found ourselves in the Home Ec room at the precise moment when Banapeel's morning coffee kicked in and he made a beeline to the bathroom to lighten his load.  Little Billy grabbed the Hutzler 571 and jammed it down his pants in a flash.  We tried to make our way to the doorway without anybody noticing us, but little Billy caught the attention of every girl in the class (if you know what I mean).  As soon as we hit the hallway, we were off and running.  We knew we would get in trouble for skipping school, but we didn't care.  We had the Hutzler 571 and it was ours.  We made it all the way to little Billy's house.  We knew we were safe there because his parents both worked during the day.  His Mom was a Slinky tester and his Dad licked envelopes for the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes.  In all the excitement after we arrived at his house, little Billy pulled the Hutzler 571 out of his pants a little too quickly.  He is now a Eunuch.But our story doesn't end there.  We buried the Hutzler 571 in little Billy's backyard to avoid suspicion.  However, we had to keep burying it because several dogs and a raccoon kept digging it back up with all of the blood on it.  After little Billy had finally healed, we decided to see what the Hutzler 571 could do.  After all, we never got that chance before due to little Billy's misfortune.  As little Billy was lifting it from the ground, the dogs were all over it, so I grabbed it and threw it like a boomerang.  With amazing accuracy it went out about 100 yards and made a perfect turn and trajectory right back to my hand.  I didn't have to move.  It was just there.  Little Billy was awestruck.  He tried to do the same thing, but failed miserably (like most paper airplanes he made in his lifetime).  Not wanting him to feel bad, I told him that maybe we could play catch with it and use it like a frisbee instead of a boomerang.  Poor little Billy lost 2 fingers that day.  He was a good sport about it, but never picked up another Hutzler 571.So, I finally had the Hutzler 571 all to myself.  I took it out and continued using it like a boomerang and found my accuracy improving exponentially.  I started taking out pigeons in mid-flight and progressed to bats at dusk.  I was getting the attention of everyone on the neighborhood and crowds started forming to watch me use my new honed skills.  The crowds grew and grew even larger.  At first I was surprised to see the college scouts, but I was more impressed to learn that Hutzler was after me to found it's very own Hutzler 571 Boomerang League.  It was when the Secret Service showed up that I started to get scared.  I was afraid that old Banapeel was finally on to me and had figured out I had pinched the Hutzler 571.  That wasn't it at all.  They wanted me to go skeet shooting with Barack Obama.  Don't tell the POTUS, but he never hit a clay pigeon to save his life.  It was really me and my Hutzler 571 hiding off in the woods.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

My uneven slicing caused me so much grief and anxiety that I was unable to leave my home for the past 20 years and have since lived with my parents.  I earn a meager living working out of my parents' basement reviewing pyrimid schemes for home based businesses and writing warnings about them on various web sites.  Thanks to Facebook, I am able to keep up with the outside world and recently changed by status to "in a relationship" with a one handed lawyer I met in a chat room.  Although we have never met in person we chat every day on FB and even have plans to Skype.  I was up late one night, I usually can't fall asleep easily since I still hear the taunts that were hurled at my growing up about my banana slicing skills.  The children were especially fond of singing "Lucy Lucy you can't slice and you will never ever be a mans wife."  Through my tears I looked up at the television screen and saw the most wonderful product on an informative info mercial.  I was skeptical but desperate.  The days awaiting its arrival were an eternity and I won't lie as sucidal thoughts did cross my mind.  Finally the postman delivered this amazing God send.  I prayed silently before attempting my first banana in over 20 years.  I was also heavily medicated and had prepared myself for dissapointment and another 20 years of living in my parents basement which occasionally floods.  Tears of gratitude flowed from my eyes as I sliced the much despised yellow fruit.  "Shock" is the only word that can describe the results as I stared in disbelief at the perfect slices.  Yes, I said "PERFECT" slices.  The years of outrage at practically being held prisioner by a crippling fear of leaving the house the sun, which I hadn't felt in ages on my skin, blinded me I triupantly yelled "How do you like me now bitch! Suck it."::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

We decided on the Hutzler because it sounded more exotic and vaguely German.So, the day it arrived, we opened the package it was shipped in and easily identified the product.  That's when the fun began.  There was a piece of paper in the packaging, but it appeared to be just the packing slip.  There was not a trace of instructions to be found anywhere!  We must have stared at that packing list for an hour, passing it back and forth between us, convinced there were instruction on how to use the dang thing somewhere.  Eventually we gave up and had to learn to use it with trial and error.What a mess that was.  I will let you all in on what we learned:DO NOT try to stand the banana on end and slice it that way.  The stem will get stuck between the blades.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and slice the stem off before using the tool.DO peel the banana first.  The blades are made of plastic and an unpeeled banana (especially a unripe one) will be horrific to try to slice with this tool.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and score the banana peel lengthwise four times, rotating the banana as you do.DO NOT buy bananas in bunches at the grocery store. You need to buy them singly.  This is because ONLY HALF THE BANANAS IN THE STORE FIT IN THIS DAMN THING!  Look closely at the product picture; you will need to buy bananas that "face" to the right.  Ones that face left won't fit.  And make sure you lay them out in your shopping cart that way carefully; we have gotten home and realized that we thought we had purchased all "righties" but had a few "lefties" when we unloaded our groceries.  If you must try a "leftie", I suggest you get a knife and cut the banana in thirds, and then flip the top and bottom parts over so that the outcast banana appears to be a "rightie".Hope this helps!::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

First that was good, but now it was bad. Allow me to explain. I recently brought the Hutzler on a flight to the East Coast. As I began slicing bananas for my own superb in-flight meal, the kid next to me got so excited he started yelling like crazy (of course, many children have this reaction when seeing it for the first time, we all know that). This got the attention of some other passengers and then a flight attendant. Upon viewing the Hutzler Handiwork (as I call it), the lame flight attendant yelled out "BANANA TERRORIST! BANANA TERRORIST!" Three rows up an Air Marshall leapt from his seat, witnessed my miracle food, and promptly shot me to death.  So I post this review posthumously, from heaven, where I sadly report... there are no bananas. I did leave Hutzlers to each of my 12  children and their 5 mothers though, so my life is in order.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

LOCAL 2024-02-12 17:13:18 INFO  Worker:57 - Received task: 9a5176f86197315e::2::RV5JS5WN4GHT5::In the late 1990s I worked as a production assistant on the film "U-571" starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, and Jon Bon Jovi, all of whom devoured entire bunches of bananas each week in order to ward off scurvy during the months-long shoot aboard a WWII era submarine.My sole responsibility on the production was to slice bananas for the actors, which I accomplished in tandem with the Best Banana Boy: he would toss the peeled bananas toward me, and using the clapperboard I would swiftly chop the fruit in mid-air, directing slices alternately into the open, awaiting mouths of McConaughey, Paxton, Keitel, Bon Jovi, and other actors & crew.During a two-day shore leave in the port of Hamburg, Germany, Bon Jovi encountered the Hutzler Brothers in an open-air market, where they were demonstrating a prototype kitchen appliance (inelegantly-named "Magische gerät das lange sanft geschwungenen frucht teilt sich in mundgerechte medaillons").  Mesmerized, he bought out their inventory and distributed them amongst his cast mates and film crew.  All were thrilled to be able to slice their own bananas and to do so in such a way that's great for cereal, plastic, and dishwasher safe.Producer Dino De Laurentiis immediately recognized that the "Magische gerät das lange sanft geschwungenen frucht teilt sich in mundgerechte medaillons" -- priced at a mere 19.99 Deutschmarks, or approx. $9.95 US (MSRP) -- could readily replace me and the Best Banana Boy (and our salaries).  Three days after we had put to sea to resume filming, the two of us were fired from the production and marooned on an archipelago 100 nautical miles west of the Canary Islands.  Fourteen years later, a passing ship found us adrift in the Atlantic Ocean, floating on a raft we had built from discarded Blockbuster Video cases which had washed ashore over the years.We returned to the United States to find a changed world: among other shocking revelations, I learned that a Communist, Haitian Muslim had been re-elected to the Presidency of the United States and, even worse, that the instrument of our demise had been rechristened "The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer" in honor of its inventors and the film production which had brought it to the New World, and that it had revolutionized the world of phallus-shaped fruit division.I am a man displaced in time, lacking the skills, knowledge, and experience to survive in the 21st century.  My sole trade and area of expertise -- clapperboard banana slicing -- has been diminished and rendered obsolete by a seemingly-magical piece of plastic fruit cutlery.My one hope is that I can establish a market for bananas sliced *lengthwise* with a clapperboard; I am also practicing lengthwise banana slicing using hedge shears to disassociate my present-day fruit-slicing techniques from the outdated methods of my Hollywood years.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 2

May not be BuRsTiNg with flavor but flavor nonetheless. The overall smell can be intoxicating. Of the three top brands here, these look the least like bears.I would recommend enjoying these with a clean palate - especially of other sweets.

My dad worked at the Hutzler Banana Slicing Research and Development Lab for 30 years! He poured his heart and soul into his work trying to come up with a cure for unevenly sliced bananas! He personally, was the sole or co-developer of over 75 models during the 80's(models 342 thru 417) He died a broken man, helping to develop the perfect banana slicer that you so casually mock! When dad passed I decided to take up his work because I was determined to not see his lifelong dream go unfulfilled! I worked tirelessly, just like Dad to help make that dream a reality! Unfortunately for me, both of my arms were ripped off while testing an experimental banana-slicing prototype. I was told that my injuries could have been much worse because the prototype was programmed to seek out banana shaped objects! Anyway, I am typing this review with my nose, in the hopes that you will cease your insensitive comments  and APPRECIATE something that so many people put so much hard work and sacrifice into!

I was expecting a smaller package and pushed the big one aside, waiting and waiting for my slicer.  Finally, I opened the big package and there were yards and yards of brown paper and what did I find in the bottom.  My banana slicer.  Now I am secure that I am in the in crowd.  Life is good.

I pressed down firmly, but the banana slicer was not effectively slicing my banana.  Finally, after much confusion and frustration, I realized you must first peel the banana before attempting to slice it with the slicer.  After I removed the peel from the banana, the slicer worked quite well.I like to carry my bananas around in my front pants pocket.  Before I purchased this product, I used to get a lot of "is that a banana in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?" jokes.  Not anymore!  The banana slices fit comfortably in my front (and back) pockets, and now my life is embarrassment-free.  Thanks Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer!As an added plus, when I'm not using it to slice my bananas, the product also works perfectly as a banana-shaped ladder for my Star Wars action figure collection.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Some 20+ years ago I left everything and everybody behind and set out for the New World, the Land of Opportunity, where people go from dishwasher to millionaire.While I have done mountains of dishes ever since my arrival here, the $$$ millions are yet to come in. Every year I would go back to Germany over the holidays to visit friends and family, and with each passing year said people tried less and less to hide their pity for poor me, who would never account to much of anything in this lifetime. Well, last Christmas, all of that changed forever!Once again the family was gathered for a holiday celebration. First, everybody sat down for a delicious dinner. How festive everything was! Set on a precious Damask tablecloth, the best Meissner Porzellan adorned the table, framed by precious silverware. And when I say silverware, I mean it was made of real silver! Over the years it had come to my parents and me being seated at the kids' table so that the more successful kids could sit with the adults. We felt like pariahs. But this year, I could not help but smile throughout the five course dinner. My parents looked at me with concern on their faces - did the years of despair finally catch up with their child? Was their child going over the edge? I could have said something right then and there, but I held my tongue.....After dinner, the family gathered around the 20' Christmas tree. A circle of wrapped gifts was laid out around the tree and after singing the obligatory "Silent Night, Holy Night", everybody was participating in an orgy of tearing gift wrap. Only my parents sat on the sidelines, watching wistfully. An hour later, after everybody had opened all of their gifts, only one mysterious package was left under the tree. The confusion was quite grand as there was no "from, to" sticker on the gift. Silence befell the room as I, with my head held high, walked over to the tree, picked up the package and gently laid it into the withered hands of my dear old mother. She looked at me somewhat puzzled, but after I gave her a confirming nod, her trembling hands proceeded to open the gift. My father, fearing the worst (another pair of gloves? a scarf?), made a move to take the gift out of mother's hands, but one look into my confident eyes, and he froze.By the time my mother had removed the gift wrap, everybody had gathered around her. People held their breath as the last piece of paper came off. You could hear a pin drop as mother opened the box! You could hear Aunt Gretchen drop as she fainted when my mother pulled out...... THE HUTZLER 571! A collective gasp went through the room - a HUTZLER 571!!! As long as I shall live I will never forget how my mother looked up at me, tears of joy and pride running over her dear wrinkled old face. My father was speechless, almost choking on tears, he shook my hand while his other hand firmly grasped my shoulder, and as his piercing eyes looked into mine I could see nothing but pride in them. Never have I seen my parents prouder and happier in their whole life! Mother held up the Hutzler 571 for everybody to see and it emitted a blinding golden glow. Gifts that my relatives had held clutched in their hands until now fell to the floor. What are diamond earrings and cufflinks compared to the blinding beauty of the Hutzler 571??? What good is that new BMW in the driveway compared to the ultimate slicing machine??? Nothing, I tell you, nothing!!!Slowly, my mother rose from her seat, and much like Moses had parted the sea, she parted the silent crowd with the Hutzler 571. My father followed, beaming with pride. As mother made her way to the grown-up table, the crowd started to regain movement. The male relatives tripped over each other in their efforts to pull chairs out for my my parents. Finally, my parents were seated at the head of the table, and after their nod of approval, the crowd sat down at the table with them. What can I tell you, it was the best Christmas ever! Champagne corks popped, my parents laughed, and amidst the joy tiny Timotheus shouted out "God bless us, each and every one of us!".And blessed all of them will be. Next Christmas, I will go back to Germany with another Hutzler 571 in my carry-on luggage. Yes, one of my many relatives will be the lucky recipient of another Hutzler 571. Due to strict export regulations I can only take one a year out of the country. I could, legally, take several Fox Run Banana Slicers out of the country, but please, c'mon now, they are COMPLETELY different! I mean, just look for yourself, do a side-by-side comparison! Who are they trying to fool?As for my parents, who knows what the future will hold for them...  Maybe the "Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer", the "Progressive International Compact Egg Slicer", or gasp, maybe even the "Fox Run Butter Spreader Stick"!?!? The future looks so bright, we've got to wear shades.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

On New Year's eve 2011, my girlfriend and I sat down for a romantic dinner at our home.  The candles were lit,  music was gently drifting through the room, and the lasagna was hot out of the oven.  At the bottom of her wine glasses rested the engagement ring, I intended to propose to her with...I'll save you the dramatics, but due to an ill-timed knock at the door, I left the room - leaving the love of my life to throw back her drink, swallowing the engagement ring in the process.Upon my return, after a brief moment of shock, I explained to my girlfriend what she had done.  I'll never forget the look on her face.  We were both bewildered on what course of action to take.After some consideration of our options, our eyes met, ans we knew exactly how to get out of this jam.  The Hutzler 571 banana slicer!Fast forward 3 days, 20 bowls of Fiber One, and 16 perfectly dissected "colon cobras" later, we located the ring!  I have to say the experience made us closer.  And best of all, she said YES!I am happy to report that she has since said ,"I doo", and we are happily married.  Best of all, our Hutzler 571 banana slicer is as sharp as ever.  It's going to be great for slicing up 'naners for our son (yes she's pregnant!).  James Hutzler Jenkins is due in July. :)::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

This is an irrefutable fact of science.The problem has always been, "How do they do it? What do they use?" Given their lack of knowledge, it was notuncommon to see a child hacking away at a banana with a spoon for hours on end, until their tears wiped the mashedpulp of their once proud fruit off the cutting board of their shattered dreams.Even worse, more adventurous children would resort to power tools. I've lost count of the number of state wardsI've lost to banana cutting related accidents in my wood shop. You might say "why don't you keep those orphansout of your woodshop?", but that is ridiculous, because I need their tiny, skillful fingers to craft the woodendowels that keep up my extravagant, banana rich lifestyle.Thankfully, the Banana Slicer solves all these problems! It is a marvel of modern science, and if onlyit could also peel the banana, I could completely prevent the loss of orphan limbs to belt sanders. Godbless you Hutzler.

LOCAL 2024-02-12 17:16:04 INFO  Worker:57 - Received task: 9a5176f86197315e::3::R3TJI9PX0NVOD0::Mine is a cautionary tale--a tale of greed, success, lust, fame--and depravity. You see, I... am a slice addict. As you will see, I was among the greatest and most profligate banana slicers in the world. My slicing was legendary. I sliced with John Belushi, Lindsay Lohan, R Kelly, George "Cowboy Banana Cowboy" Bush, Barack "Slicedaddy" Obama, Keith Richards-I once sliced with Chris Farley for 60 hours straight. I was living the high life, until it all came crashing down around me.You see, for years, I was lost in a morass of banana-slicing impotence, aimlessly wandering through life obsessed with finding the perfect banana-slicing instrument. A simple google search yields thousands of competent and admirable banana-slicing products and methods, or b-slizzle as we slice addicts call it, but none measured up to my expectations of banana-slicing grace. I was a substance addict, my tonic being a soft, smooth, perfect banana slice. At first, it was a simple hobby. Like most of you, I would spend no more than five or six hours a day slicing, displaying, posting on facebook, and then consuming. Of course it's probably obvious to most of you now that for those of us with the sliceaholic gene, this level of slicing is not near enough to satiate our desires and can only end up in disaster. But being a true addict, I was blind to the pain I was causing others and deaf to the warnings of friends, family and activists. I ended up hurting those who love me the most: kids, grandkids, wives, parents, and my pet hedgehogs. It got to the point where I would stay awake for days straight pushing my bananas through the strings of my guitar and then shaking them out of the hole or shoving bananas through the chicken wire surrounding my hedgehogs. But the banana slices, magnificent as they were, would inevitably end up getting eaten by the hedgehogs or tasting like guitar. From there I began to explore new and dangerous slice methods-methods that would connect me to both the glamorous side of b-slizzling and the deadly underworld of slice addicts.A typical day for me would begin at the banana factory, trading sex or drugs or cash for a fresh batch of newly-minted bananas. Green, yellow, brown-it mattered not. It was all about the slice for me, as any slice addict can attest. From there I would cruise the whittling district with nothing but a knapsack or barrel full of bananas and a bowie knife, selling my flesh to knife artisans for their crafting of slices. But still, the bananas were sliced only to near-perfection, leaving me craving more and better slice every time. I had already been kicked out of every Japanese restaurant from Houston to Chicago for throwing bananas at the chefs to cut in the air. In my insatiable lust for the smooth sensuality of fresh banana slices, I was blind to the racial insensitivity of this practice. I cannot even begin to count the number of kids around town whose bicycles I stole, just to feed my lust for the reckless and dangerous practice of spoke-slicing, or "splicing" as we call it.As I found newer, more efficient-and often ruthless-slizz techniques, I became more and more careless and violent, but still, it was ever enough. I was arrested at home furnishing stores for pushing thousands of bananas through their window blind displays (blindspotting). I was walking around day and night wearing nothing but multi-blade ice skates just to slice the thousands of bananas littering the floor of my home and yard at any given time (figureslicing). I can't tell you how many poor hedgehogs I killed or maimed because of those shoes. I wasted tens of thousands of dollars on designer grade electric and solar-powered fans with razor-sharp blades to accommodate the immense volume of slicing I was pushing on a daily basis (blowing). I always tried to use solar fans to reduce my carbon footprint.Of course this enslaving lifestyle could not be sustained forever. My picture was on the wall of every Benihana in the southwest. Children all over the state had replaced their traditional spoked wheels with solid spokes, and the motocross bullies would turn their bikes on me and beat me senseless when I would stand alongside the supercross track shoving b into their frenzied wheel-spinning (motoring). On October 3rd, 2007, I had hit rock bottom. I had just slizzed with Sean and Biggie in the Hamptons (he's still alive, turning tricks for b in the banana underworld). I awoke from a potassium coma to find my bank account, formerly over twenty million dollars, completely dry. Everybody talked about the housing and equities markets crashing, but let me tell you, the crisis hit the slicers bad!. My credit cards were all cut off, and my lines of credit with the banks and various banana slicing venture capitalists were dry. And the hedgehogs had revolted in a bloody uprising, known as The Bloody Hedgehog Uprising.As I write to you today, from the comfort of my humble country cottage, I do so giving grace to god, with sorrow and gratitude to those whose lives I crushed and those who stood by me through all the finger cuts and slipping on peels. I have found a tranquil peace, all thanks to the hundreds of amazing, beautiful people who made the H-5 a reality.I will skip the platitudes so pervasive in all the reviews of this magnificent product and cut to the chase. CUT TO THE CHASE. That's what the H-5 does. I call it the H-5 for short and because H-5 sounds almost as awesome as the H-5 is. Who knew that I could find peace from such a complex, yet simple, engineering marvel. You would think that I would have had to walk away cold-turkey, but for me, the game was all about the perfect slice. You see, once you find the perfect slice, your life is at peace. And that is what I have found-what I find every day-the perfect slice. Although my H-5 background check revealed to many illicit banana incidents in the past to procure one legally, I was able to receive a presidential pardon from George Bush because he knows I could blow the whistle on his falsified reports on Saddam's WMB's (Wildly Massive B-Slicers) and from Barack Obama because of the help I offered in getting Obamaslice to the socialists.So kids, understand that banana slicing is not as glamorous as all those billboards in the 70s portrayed it, and can be done in a safe and fun manner from your own home for under five dollars. I sincerely hope that the scientists and board members of Hutzler continue forward and attack similar cancers on humanity like methamphetamines, aids and immigration. So much gratitude goes to Anthony Weiner for bringing bananas into the public eye and to Fox News for having the conviction to doggedly pursue this story in hopes of bringing down the banana-controlled senate. May you all experience the joy and frivolity of the H-571. Peace and love to all.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

But instead of salvation, the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has brought me nothing but bitter frustration and despondency.Before I go any further, I would like to voice my objection to the obviously euphemistic and wholly inappropriate product description on the Amazon page - "Kids love slicing their own bananas".  Really, Hutzler?  You left out, "Nudge, nudge, wink, wink!"  Shame on you.Now, I should point out that I have benefitted from other banana-assistive technology.  I have been using the Apogee Banana Peeler BPX52Z for several years.  But this product, effective as it is, as far as it goes, leaves the user with a still-intact fruit dog.  What to do?  So, after years of having to throw away hundreds of unsliced (and therefore, obviously inedible) bananas, along comes Hutzler to the rescue.  I knew I must have this technological marvel, no matter what the cost.After months living a Spartan existence and saving every penny, I finally amassed enough money to cover the purchase price.  When the box finally arrived at my door, I was so elated that I kissed the UPS driver.  On the lips.  Needless to say, I was happy and excited.  I was glad to get my banana slicer, too.After gleefully tearing through the packing materials, I was shocked to discover that my 571 came with no, I repeat, NO instruction manual.  How the hell am I supposed to figure this out myself?!  Hey Hutzler - not everyone is a University of Phoenix graduate, you know?Fortunately, my next door neighbor has a Spider monkey, Peanut, who was able to demonstrate proper operation of this device.  So, great - all that ends well is well, right?  Not this time.As mentioned, intentionally or not, no instruction manual was included.  Nonetheless, I've mastered the slicing procedure (thanks to Peanut).  But now, how do I get the freshly-sliced fruit disks from the plate to my mouth?  I've asked Peanut to show me, but he always puts them in HIS mouth, which does me no good.Does Hutzler also offer a Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance System?  It is simply cruel to take people half-way there, and then mock them by leaving them helplessly staring at a plate of sweet (I can only assume, of course) slices.By proffering the 571 Banana Slicer, is Hutzler truly attempting to help humanity, or is this nothing more than a sadistic joke, meant to exploit the limitations of human cognition and perseverance, and the fragility of emotion?  Are they part of some nefarious collusive plot, along with Apogee, to drive the human race mad, one banana lover at a time??So what's your deal, Hutzler?  What other instruments of torture do you brutes have in that treacherous treasure trove you call a product line?  Bottomless mugs?  Pencils with erasers on both ends?  Hornet-filled piñatas?  You vicious bastards!While I am grateful for the new relationship that has blossomed with Carl (the UPS guy), no other good has come of this purchase, and l feel Hutzler needs to make this right, not just for me, but for everyone.To all other victims of this mean-spirited chicanery (Chiquitery?), if we do not soon receive satisfaction, I suggest we file a class action suit, to "peel" away the façade, and expose the conspiracy.  This isn't a banana republic.  This is America, dammit!  Let the revolution begin here...Now, then...were the manufacturer to see their way clear to send me one of those Banana Slice Plate-To-Mouth Guidance Systems for free (WITH INSTRUCTIONS), I'm sure we could put all this ugliness behind us.  The banana's in your court, Hutzler...::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

The description does not say so, but the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, unlike other Hutzler BS models, lacks iPhone integration.Not sure if this was just a design oversight, a deliberate effort by Hutzler to marginalize Apple's profits, or just a reflection of the natural animosity between Apple and Banana.At any rate, after multiple calls to the Hutzler I.T. department went nowhere (high call volume), I came up with my own work-around.  Here's what you need to do:1) Balance the two ends of the 571 Banana Slicer on two soup cans.  (Campbell's "Double Noodle" works best -- Do NOT use Minestrone)2) Place your cereal bowl between the soup cans.3) Place peeled banana on top of the 571 Banana Slicer.  (Banana MUST be pre-peeled.  Will NOT work if you wait to peel it later, per my results on several tries!)4) Place iPhone flush with the 571 over the banana and apply downward pressure, uniformly, keeping the iPhone flat.If you do this correctly, the banana will be forced through the 571 Banana Slicer by the force of the iPhone.  Many of the slices will land in your cereal bowl.  Switch your iPhone to the "spoon" app and enjoy!This work-around makes the 571 usable despite the lack of iPhone integration, but all in all it may be better appreciated by those with smart phones running Android.The 571 is still worth every penny, even for iPhone users, since the technique above will allow you to get perfectly sliced bananas with a lot less pulp sticking in the grooves and buttons than the "old" way of slicing bananas with your iPhone.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Are you the sort of man who would peel a banana whole before eating it or retain the peel and peel the skin down gradually as you take a bite? Now, a clever man would peel a banana whole, because he would know that only a great fool would allow the peel to hang loosely over his hand. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose to retain the peel. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose to discard the banana peel.However, because the banana comes from Southeast Asia, as everyone knows, and Southeast Asia is entirely peopled with criminals, and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me, so I can clearly not choose to retain the banana peel. But you must have suspected I would have known the banana's origin, so I can clearly not choose to discard the peel.You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have offered to take the banana peel, trusting in your strength to save you, so I can clearly not choose to discard the peel. But you've also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man might one day invent an ingenious way of cutting a banana such as the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, so you would have put the banana peel as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose to retain the peel.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

But if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.It began with a noticeable change in the viscosity of my saliva. Within minutes of consumption, my mouth had filled with a thick foamy slime. Though I was in a cool climate controlled room a salty sweat broke out, and I felt my heartbeat quicken as my body threw itself into fight or flight.The animal noises broadcasting from my pelvis were an ominous warning of the violent acts that were to follow. I shouldered my way into the bathroom, clawing at my belt, moaning with pain. The smell came first. It started sweet, almost tangy. That was quickly overpowered by a cloying chemical perfume.The first volley of feces hit the water like soda cans and nickles. The resulting splash drenching my bottom in foul brackish water, but this was quickly becoming the least of my worries.After another moment, the noises in my core hit a fever pitch and I was struck rigid with pain. The sweat was now running into my eyes, but the room had turned ice cold and my hands began to spasm.I felt an insidious burning flooding my escape hatch. I gasped. Hot yellow poison began spraying from my rear, changing in pitch and echo as the stream of diarrhea whipped around the toilet bowl, creating a nightmarish Doppler effect that can only be appreciated in hindsight.My legs fell asleep sitting on the toilet. I couldn't have stood up if I wanted to.Wiping was a no-go. Toilet paper simply became a vile paper mache'. My hands were quickly soiled. A full blown shower was needed, and all of my towels had to be burned.So happy with my purchase, would recommend to friends and definitely buying again!::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 1

Sure, as long as you pick them up in 5 seconds or less, who's the wiser? But who can gather up 18 banana slices in 5 seconds?? Maybe if Amazon can get legislation passed to increase the 5-second rule ceiling to something like, oh say 20 seconds, this would be a useable product. I really don't see both sides of the aisle in Congress coming together to avoid the 5-second cliff though.Or perhaps Amazon could package it with something that can catch the banana slices and keep them off the floor...like a table, or counter-top or something like that. Solve this issue and you're talking about a 5-star product here!Until then, I guess I'll just have to make the kids kneel on the floor and catch the banana slices in their mouths as they fall. Sure is difficult to get 18 kids into a group that small on the floor though....::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Irregular and lumpy, the slices just didn't make the mark. Gurtzenhulu, (my son,) frustrated by the ugly fruit, once slammed down his book, sending the Hutzler flying from between the pages. It hung in the air, rotating as though suspended, before coming down perfectly upon a peeled banana sitting on the cutting board. As if by magic, seeing the 18 perfect pieces lying there, framed by the yellow cutting tool, we gasped as though struck. It was my wife, Marphlezik, who screamed first."Banana sliced perfectly, oh my gracious gracious gracious gracious, oh my!!! Peabody, come and lookeee!!"  She called to our daughter.  Peabody come a runnin' and we marveled at the wonder of it all. "Oh muh gawd, purty little slices sliced like slices!" Peabody gurggled, stuffing each banana partition in her slotted, barely toothed mouth. Little bits of 'nana spilt from betwixt her lips. A chunk lodged in my eye. Through the tears, I saw the wobbly figures of my family transformed into a happy party marred only by indentured servitude.Well done, Huzler. Well done.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Its bright yellow color makes it a novelty item and, as such, a natural conversation piece. I hoped it would brighten the mood of my home, and it did--at first.I noticed that the frequency of visitations to my home by friends and relatives spiked rapidly. Within a week, I counted some thirty unique visitors, some of whom I had never seen before. Within a month, though I am a naturally introspective man and prefer a quiet life, I was having parties on an almost nightly basis and masses of people were circulating through my home at all hours of the night.I also found myself eating more bananas. I purchased a full bunch and found that the H571 made preparing them a breeze. I put them in cereal for breakfast, salads for lunch, and banana bread for dinner. I put bananas in buns with ketchup, relish, cheddar cheese, and chili. I also marinated bananas in teriyaki sauce and grilled them with rice and shrimp. I couldn't get enough.While I was at the grocery store purchasing more bananas for my H571, I noticed a strong, hunchbacked man glaring at me. He tried to be inconspicuous by testing the firmness of tomatoes and looking away every time I gazed in his direction, but no matter how many times he looked away, his eyes kept wandering back to me.I thought nothing of it until I saw the same man in a suit, following me in town a few days later. Then I was spooked. I walked fast and he walked fast. I ran and he ran. I ducked into a tattoo parlor and he followed me in. It was a small shop, and with my luck no one was up front, waiting for prospective clients. The hunchbacked man came into the store and pointed what felt like a banana into my back."There's something you need to know about your H571," he said."How did you know?" I said.He said no more. He turned me around and gave me a shove out the door. A black sedan was waiting on the street. The door opened and two more hunchbacks were inside. I noticed they all had the number 17 tattooed on their wrist. We drove to what appeared to be an abandoned armory building in a neglected district downtown.The hunchbacks escorted me toward the building, warning me not to dare make a sound.I was almost inside when, in a blinding yellow flash, my H571 boomeranged into my hand. It was glowing and no longer felt like plastic. It was supple and fluidly extended when I flicked it to the left or right.The hunchbacks were suddenly afraid of me. They kept their distance as I backed away toward the street.A yellow cab came by and I got in.As I drove away, the hunchbacks pleaded with me that I had much to learn about the power I possessed with the H571, and that they could teach me. But how could I trust them?When I looked down, my H571 had returned to its normal plastic state and I haven't been able to trigger its bizarre properties since.I'm glad I purchased the H571--I now believe it is much more than a banana slicer--and I hope to report on its exact nature in more detail as my understanding of it grows.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

My wife left me because she had no home and no potato. I then got hit by a car while mowing the lawn. I saw the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer on Amazon and ordered it (to a PO Box, because I had no house) because of the Amazon reviews. I received the box with such glee that I tripped on a brick step and broke my ankle. Turns out the brick was loose because of a safe deposit box key was left under it. After weeks of searching the internet (on wireless, because I had no house), I found the bank the key belonged to. In this bank, a box full of bearer bonds and a small bag of cocaine. I quickly snorted the cocaine and cashed in the bearer bonds. Today, I am a billionaire software developer with an amazing banana slicer that slices bananas pretty well. I recommend this product. I still don't have a house, though.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

I purchase about 20-25 pounds of bananas at a time for dehydration. Before purchasing the banana slicer, I just cut the bananas with a butter knife.  My slices would not all be the same thickness and would not dehydrate in the same amount of time. The banana slicer helps maintain a consistent thickness for all the slices and provides a more even dehdration. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because it would be nice if the slices were thinner. I prefer 1/4" slices for dehydrated bananas and these are about 1/2" thick.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

The Hutzler Banana Slicer (HBL) is a dream come true. (Hutzler, why did you wait so long?)This beautiful product--it's yellow, just like bananas!--slices an entire banana in a single stroke. If you were to slice the banana with a knife, it would probably take you an extra 10 seconds to do it. Also, let's say you want to slice only half of the banana. You can cut it in half with the knife and then slice one half with the HBS. And the next day you'll have the other half to eat! (Just be sure to put the second half into the refrigerator right after you slice the first half because the second half will be too squishy-gooey for the next day. Who likes to eat squishy-gooey banana halves or slices? I sure don't.)I'm giving the HBS only 4 stars, though, because of what is a major drawback--for me at least:  I like my banana slices to be about 1/5th inch wide. The HBS slices your banana into pieces that are 1/4th inch wide. The 1/5th inch width slices look much nicer on top of a bowl of granola. Perhaps more important is the fact that eating 1/5th inch slices is easier on your digestive system, not to mention how gobbling down 1/4th inch slices makes you look like a starving pig. Think about it. You know I'm speaking the truth.Bottom line?  Well, do NOT let the slice width keep you from using the Hutzler Banana Slicer. If you don't buy one, you won't possess what surely must be the finest banana slicer on the market. Heck, it might even be the only banana slicer on the market. I guess the only way I could find out is to google "banana slicer" on Google.com. You can find info on just about everything on Google--even maps! I love the internet.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Sure, as long as you pick them up in 5 seconds or less, who's the wiser? But who can gather up 18 banana slices in 5 seconds?? Maybe if Amazon can get legislation passed to increase the 5-second rule ceiling to something like, oh say 20 seconds, this would be a useable product. I really don't see both sides of the aisle in Congress coming together to avoid the 5-second cliff though.Or perhaps Amazon could package it with something that can catch the banana slices and keep them off the floor...like a table, or counter-top or something like that. Solve this issue and you're talking about a 5-star product here!Until then, I guess I'll just have to make the kids kneel on the floor and catch the banana slices in their mouths as they fall.

I was then able to work with the fruit department tech team and jotted down some notes.Instructions:1) Go to the "start" menu and search for "config.sys" file.2) In a SEPARATE search window, manually browse your desktop for the "Hutzler 571b patch for Windows 8 banana slicer usage (Anglais)"3) Double click the patch file icon, when it opens, click "disable autorun," then close the file.4) Going back to the patch file icon, RIGHT CLICK the icon and select "open with"5) Open with the notepad application.6) Scroll to line 371 and highlight lines 371 - 1114. Right mouse click and select "Copy"7) Going back to config.sys file opened in step 1, open in "basic editor."8) When the configuration file opens, disable (ignore button) the two warning screens that pop up.9) Scroll to line 22453, and type (rem) in front of the first semicolon BUT BEFORE the \\ signs.

(EXCEPT 314a-d and any of the "M300" series military use field banana slicing units.)10) Scroll to line 14234, add a line and hit paste; this will add lines 371 - 1114 of the patch code.11) Hit close, then "save edits."12) Re-open the patch file icon. Enable autorun. Close patch file.13) Re-open the patch file.14) After 20 or 30 seconds (while autorunning) a message window will appear with the message "Hutzler 571b now installed."15) Select "set default actions".16) Click "autodetect left/right fruit polarity" (this will be a HUGE timesaver later, allowing for left/right handed fruit processing WITHOUT having to purchase the Hutzler 571C or utilizing the rug-drop technique mentioned in previous reviews.(FINALLY!!!!))17) Click "enable onboard camera use"; when the yellow warning window opens click "allow." (You may have to disable any Norton software you have running at this point and retry; check the YouTube video.)18) Click "save autodetect state", then click save configuration state. (You can create a backup file at this point if you wish, I recommend this if you are planning to clone this drive or migrate this file to additional 571b banana slicing machines.)19) Re-boot machine.Its just that simple! You are now ready to use your Hutzler 571B banana slicer on a Windows 8 platform for both left and right hand polarity bananas! ENJOY!Note: The above instructions are intended for use on 64bit machines only! If you are using a 32bit machine, you may have to add a re-routing line to the Hutzler 571b process redirector applet located in your Start-Up folder, but that should be obvious!!!)::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

I have wanted a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer ever since my daughter found the reviews for it on Amazon a few years ago and read them aloud to me while I was driving.  Of course, I nearly ran off the road several times, I was laughing so hard, but we made it safely in the end without getting pulled over.  Although, if we had been, all we would have needed to do was to read a couple reviews to the cop.  I think he would have forgiven us!  Ever since then, I have wanted my very own 571B Banana Slicer--and now I have one!For Christmas brunch, my daughter-in-law asked me to make a fruit salad, and I was so excited to use my new Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer!  I made the salad the night before, but took the intact bananas, my 571B Banana Slicer, and the reviews along so that everyone could enjoy the process.  It was so much FUN slicing my bananas, although I do recommend removing all the stringy things BEFORE you slice.  It's really hard to pick little short sliced-up pieces of stringy stuff off of every slice!I have one suggestion for the Hutzler company:  You need to invent a 571B-B Banana Slicer for those who like thin slices.  These slices are awfully thick, especially for small children.  And trust me, it's REALLY HARD to slice a banana, then have to line the slices up right next to each other, move the Banana Slicer over half a slice--and slice a second time to get nice, thin slices.  You mostly end up with banana purée, which is nice if you're feeding a baby or a really old person, but not so nice for a fancy Christmas fruit salad.One more suggestion for Amazon--MAKE A BOOK OF THE REVIEWS OF THE HUTZLER 571B BANANA SLICER!  I would buy one for every single person in my family--and there are lots of us!I'm attaching photos of me proudly slicing my first banana, as well as the fruit salad with those lovely, perfect little slices of banana.

At least, not since I purchased this handy-dandy slicer when I saw it on special for under $3 including s/h.Nowadays, as soon as I see a few brown spots, I just zip off the peel, press this nifty tool over the banana, and freeze my sliced bananas for use in smoothies, cereals, what-have-you.  And, it's easy to remove the slices too ... sometimes, I can hold it on both ends and wiggle and the banana slices will just fall out. For the stubborn ones, just a light tap slicer end(s) on a hard surface, and out they pop.The slicer is HUGE, by the way, and might work even on plantains(???).  On the small-average sized banana, it takes a little maneuvering to place the huge cutter, and some slices will come out quite angled while the others will be uniformly rounded.  No matter, a slice is a slice, is a slice.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

It seems her unborn baby was craving a banana for breakfast.  Unfortunately, the expectant mother was experiencing pregnancy induced carpal tunnel in her right hand which rendered the hand absolutely useless (in a related side note, she also specifically refers to this uncontrollable hand as “The Claw!” from the movie Liar Liar).  How was she supposed to cut and eat this banana the Claw she wondered?  So began the process of trial and error.  The banana was ripe, so she was able to “claw” the fruit and bash it on the edge of the counter to get the peel to break open.  But then she dropped it on the kitchen floor on account of useless Claw, but was able to pick it up with her left hand.  After it was skinned, she attempted to use a steak knife (that she stole from a nearby five star steakhouse) with her left hand to slice it into equal 1/4” wide slices.  But her luck just couldn't improve—it was a right-handed knife! Being in a bit of an exhausted rage, she threw the banana into the a Magic Bullet and made a banana mash.  According to the mother, that’s not what the baby ordered!  I gave her the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer product the day after the incident (Amazon Prime Free Two-Day Shipping delivered in only one day!) and it solved all of her life’s problems.  The mother and baby lived happily ever after!::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

As I began slicing bananas for my own superb in-flight meal, the kid next to me got so excited he started yelling like crazy (of course, many children have this reaction when seeing it for the first time, we all know that). This got the attention of some other passengers and then a flight attendant. Upon viewing the Hutzler Handiwork (as I call it), the lame flight attendant yelled out "BANANA TERRORIST! BANANA TERRORIST!" Three rows up an Air Marshall leapt from his seat, witnessed my miracle food, and promptly shot me to death.  So I post this review posthumously, from heaven, where I sadly report... there are no bananas.

After floundering around looking for strategies and materials that will produce smarter, more engaged students with better test scores, we went all in and ordered 20,000 Hutzler 571's so every student and staff member has one for home and school.Before we Hutzlerized our math curriculum, our students tests scores were in the toilet. The revolutionary abacus adaptor kit we developed for the Hutzler allows our students to perform math functions from simple counting for kindergarten,  addition/subtraction for primary; multiplication/division and on through square and cube roots. Algebraic, calculus, etc algothrithms are being developed.When we got our fall math test scores back we were astounded!! Our students are now outperforming the Finnish, Chinese, and Singapore students. It's just unbelievable how excited our students are about their Hutzler math program. They don't even want to use their calculators anymore.We've also totally Hutzlerized our music program. Instruments cost too much money, so now we just use the Hutzler 571 for middle and high school band. Our incredible music teacher has come up with amazing techniques and arrangements for Hutzler kazoo and percussion. Of course, our middle school boys quickly figured out how to use the Hutzler under their armpit to produce additional musical offerings. Our incredible Hutzler concerts move everyone to tears.We are continually discovering new, wonderful uses for the Hutzler 571 in the educational setting. Our school nurses now use the Hutzler as a useful device for checking students for head lice. With a Hutzler in each hand the nurse can pull back the hair and probe the nits with the pointed end. We now have the highest percentage of lice reduction in the state!! Thank you Hutzler!,To conclude, as a 25 year veteran educator, I no longer feel like a dispirited, underpaid, underappreciated grunt. Thanks to the Hutzler 571, my passion for teaching has never been better, and I'm just one of many teachers in our district thinking and dreaming up incredible new lesson plans to incorporate our beloved banana slicers!Hutzler, because of you were no longer a failing school district and we've left no kid behind,::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

You see, my grandmother died 17 years ago.  For at least 20 years prior to her death, my grandma ate Corn Flakes with sliced bananas on it for breakfast every single morning.  On her deathbed, she grabbed my hand and said "Barbara, if only....if only I hadn't had to slice those bananas every morning, I could have had a few more years!  Slicing those darn bananas took years off my life!  You--my brilliant granddaughter--you must invent something that will slice the bananas so as to give other seniors a few more years--years I wish I still had!  You must do it!"Well, as I am still grieving the loss of my grandmother, I have been unable to work on inventing something to slice bananas.  Imagine my surprise to find that it had been invented--thus saving me the time-consuming process of designing, engineering, acquiring a patent, all of that stuff. Thank you Hutzler!I have ordered two cases of these wonderful items.  My parents will now have more time left...time they won't have to spend slicing bananas over their cereal.  I plan on ordering more of them to take to the senior villages around here and distributing them (I live in Florida, we have an overabundance or seniors down here).  Once I get the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the hands of every senior citizen in Florida, I will work on younger populations.  This product could, conceivably, add years to the average persons' lifespan.  It could also result in more money in Hutzler's pocket, as I am sure once folks start using the right-handed slicer, they will want to order the left-handed slicer.For years I have been searching for my mission in life.  Distributing the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to senior citizens, I now believe, is my calling.  If I can save even ONE grandchild the grief I have experienced at my grandmother losing years--YEARS!!--of her life due to having to slice bananas then it will be worthwhile.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

As an officer of the law, I spend a great deal of time on the road in my unit. Often I do not have enough time to eat so ill bring a grand ole banana for the road. Often when my stomach rumbles for potassium and substance I look to my banana with despair as I realize my duty knife will not suffice in cutting the banana into manageable road slices. Out of frustration I hook the banana to my gun belt until I feel I'll have enough time to slice it. This was a wonderful idea... Until the day I had to clear a building with a possible suspect inside. I went to draw my duty weapon but in my haste I drew the banana. Luckily I squished it hard enough that I was able to survive the situation as the unsheathed banana fired out like a projectile, dropping the suspect. Since I've acquired the the B571, this has never happened since, (thank God). Do not bring a banana to a gun fight, but do make room on your gun belt for the B571 banana slicer.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Some 20+ years ago I left everything and everybody behind and set out for the New World, the Land of Opportunity, where people go from dishwasher to millionaire.While I have done mountains of dishes ever since my arrival here, the $$$ millions are yet to come in. Every year I would go back to Germany over the holidays to visit friends and family, and with each passing year said people tried less and less to hide their pity for poor me, who would never account to much of anything in this lifetime. Well, last Christmas, all of that changed forever!Once again the family was gathered for a holiday celebration. First, everybody sat down for a delicious dinner. How festive everything was! Set on a precious Damask tablecloth, the best Meissner Porzellan adorned the table, framed by precious silverware. And when I say silverware, I mean it was made of real silver! Over the years it had come to my parents and me being seated at the kids' table so that the more successful kids could sit with the adults. We felt like pariahs. But this year, I could not help but smile throughout the five course dinner. My parents looked at me with concern on their faces - did the years of despair finally catch up with their child? Was their child going over the edge? I could have said something right then and there, but I held my tongue.....After dinner, the family gathered around the 20' Christmas tree. A circle of wrapped gifts was laid out around the tree and after singing the obligatory "Silent Night, Holy Night", everybody was participating in an orgy of tearing gift wrap. Only my parents sat on the sidelines, watching wistfully. An hour later, after everybody had opened all of their gifts, only one mysterious package was left under the tree. The confusion was quite grand as there was no "from, to" sticker on the gift. Silence befell the room as I, with my head held high, walked over to the tree, picked up the package and gently laid it into the withered hands of my dear old mother. She looked at me somewhat puzzled, but after I gave her a confirming nod, her trembling hands proceeded to open the gift. My father, fearing the worst (another pair of gloves? a scarf?), made a move to take the gift out of mother's hands, but one look into my confident eyes, and he froze.By the time my mother had removed the gift wrap, everybody had gathered around her. People held their breath as the last piece of paper came off. You could hear a pin drop as mother opened the box! You could hear Aunt Gretchen drop as she fainted when my mother pulled out...... THE HUTZLER 571! A collective gasp went through the room - a HUTZLER 571!!! As long as I shall live I will never forget how my mother looked up at me, tears of joy and pride running over her dear wrinkled old face. My father was speechless, almost choking on tears, he shook my hand while his other hand firmly grasped my shoulder, and as his piercing eyes looked into mine I could see nothing but pride in them. Never have I seen my parents prouder and happier in their whole life! Mother held up the Hutzler 571 for everybody to see and it emitted a blinding golden glow. Gifts that my relatives had held clutched in their hands until now fell to the floor. What are diamond earrings and cufflinks compared to the blinding beauty of the Hutzler 571??? What good is that new BMW in the driveway compared to the ultimate slicing machine??? Nothing, I tell you, nothing!!!Slowly, my mother rose from her seat, and much like Moses had parted the sea, she parted the silent crowd with the Hutzler 571. My father followed, beaming with pride. As mother made her way to the grown-up table, the crowd started to regain movement. The male relatives tripped over each other in their efforts to pull chairs out for my my parents. Finally, my parents were seated at the head of the table, and after their nod of approval, the crowd sat down at the table with them. What can I tell you, it was the best Christmas ever! Champagne corks popped, my parents laughed, and amidst the joy tiny Timotheus shouted out "God bless us, each and every one of us!".And blessed all of them will be. Next Christmas, I will go back to Germany with another Hutzler 571 in my carry-on luggage. Yes, one of my many relatives will be the lucky recipient of another Hutzler 571. Due to strict export regulations I can only take one a year out of the country. I could, legally, take several Fox Run Banana Slicers out of the country, but please, c'mon now, they are COMPLETELY different! I mean, just look for yourself, do a side-by-side comparison! Who are they trying to fool?As for my parents, who knows what the future will hold for them...  Maybe the "Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer", the "Progressive International Compact Egg Slicer", or gasp, maybe even the "Fox Run Butter Spreader Stick"!?!? The future looks so bright, we've got to wear shades.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

We decided on the Hutzler because it sounded more exotic and vaguely German.So, the day it arrived, we opened the package it was shipped in and easily identified the product.  That's when the fun began.  There was a piece of paper in the packaging, but it appeared to be just the packing slip.  There was not a trace of instructions to be found anywhere!  We must have stared at that packing list for an hour, passing it back and forth between us, convinced there were instruction on how to use the dang thing somewhere.  Eventually we gave up and had to learn to use it with trial and error.What a mess that was.  I will let you all in on what we learned:DO NOT try to stand the banana on end and slice it that way.  The stem will get stuck between the blades.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and slice the stem off before using the tool.DO peel the banana first.  The blades are made of plastic and an unpeeled banana (especially a unripe one) will be horrific to try to slice with this tool.  If you must try it this way, I suggest you get a knife and score the banana peel lengthwise four times, rotating the banana as you do.DO NOT buy bananas in bunches at the grocery store. You need to buy them singly.  This is because ONLY HALF THE BANANAS IN THE STORE FIT IN THIS DAMN THING!  Look closely at the product picture; you will need to buy bananas that "face" to the right.  Ones that face left won't fit.  And make sure you lay them out in your shopping cart that way carefully; we have gotten home and realized that we thought we had purchased all "righties" but had a few "lefties" when we unloaded our groceries.  If you must try a "leftie", I suggest you get a knife and cut the banana in thirds, and then flip the top and bottom parts over so that the outcast banana appears to be a "rightie".Hope this helps!::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

Day in and day out, year in and year out, I bought into the lie, automating each and every facet of my life. Take, for instance, the 'simple' action of slicing a banana. For years I coveted some device that could make this begruding task simpler, and upon gaining the ranks of adulthood, I finally acquired the one tool that could provide me the simplicity I needed to cut my bananas: the Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf ShredderPatriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. Power, speed and immortality were now at the cusp of my intention, and I knew that I had finally arrived.But with age comes experience, and with experience, wisdom. I soon realized the addiction to unleaded gasoline I had developed. The fear of being unable to cut my own bananas with such ease crept through my soul like the malignant cancer it was. Therapy was no help, and the pills did nothing to quiet the cacophony of voices screaming for sanity in my head. I began to purchase larger and larger gasoline containers in the hope that I would have enough gasoline on hand should I forget my daily trip to 7-11 for a donut and a slushie. 5 gallons became 10, 10 became 100, and soon the ATF was at my doorstep demanding the removal of the second 10,000 gallon gasoline tank I had just finished installing in my backyard (made all the more difficult by the fact that I do not support The Man by linking my domicile to electricity or water). They claimed the judge agreed with them. They claimed the city agreed with them. Fools, could they not see the predicament, nay, the impending doom that silently waited the moment when I could no longer cut My BANANAS!Living in a society so decrepit, so corrupt, so filled with its own ambition that the only possible outcome is it's own demise is not an easy thing with which to live. It was obvious to me and mine that these attempts at preparation were doomed to failure, and so the stage was set. These gasoline haters were the harbingers of the apocalypse, one which I could not avoid without endangering my own ability to cut bananas with my Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder. I slipped into depression, a black hole from which I knew no escape existed. I was destined to a life living in fear of the days when I would be forced, through sheer survival, to attempt eating a banana without it being cut. I ask the reader to forgive the vivid imagery, and I fully understand if you must leave now to quiet the wailing grief of the women and children, those who cannot bear such a thought.Behold, I have been vindicated! I have been released from such a death grip on my soul! Now, thanks to the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I have found a way to continue cutting my bananas long after mankind has ceased to suckle at the teat of fossil fuel dependence. I will preserve my precious Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the vault, where it will stand ready for all of my banana cutting needs. Gas powered appliances have their place in every modern kitchen, and the usefulness of such a treasure from the Gods will not go unused. But when it is starved to death by the inability of mankind to share scarce resources with their neighbors in need as my last drop of ethanol-laden unleaded is consumed by the death throttle of my Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder Patriot Products CSV-3100B 10 HP Briggs & Stratton Gas-Powered Wood Chipper/Leaf Shredder, I will be able to give it the proper burial and funeral rites it deserves. I will be able to continue on, day to day in an Armageddon wasteland filled with uncut bananas, secure in the knowledge that those whom I hold dear will still benefit from my foresight, planning, and Godgiven blessing that is this simple, handheld device. It requires nothing more than the power of my own muscle, being powered by the fruit of the cut bananas this so freely gives, and thus the circle is rendered complete and prophecy from ages past fulfilled.I wish you the same liberation and freedom that I have discovered through this technology handed to mankind by ninja monks dwelling deep inside the earth's cavernous center.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

Do you really want to start thinking of your dishwasher as the ultimate solution to life's problems? Not a good idea.So if it's so impractical, why do I give this product five stars? Because it has another purpose, something it does astoundingly well: You can use it to hang-dry and re-use pieces of dental floss. I have about 30 strands going on mine as we speak. I'll probably never have to buy another spool of floss again.And because it's shaped like a banana, you can hang it in your kitchen and add a festive, novel floss-themed accent to the friendliest room in your house. (If your bathroom is the friendliest room in your house, you obviously don't need any help in the decorating department.)

I used to make 2-3 trips a month to the ER due to banana-slicing injuries, so this has been a Godsend. However, if you're thinking of buying one, you have to be aware of something very important...The Hutzler 571 is designed for use by AT&T Wireless and Metro PC customers. It is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. You can try using it with Verizon Wireless, but not all of the features will be available. Unfortunately, the only VW-compatible product, the Apple iSlice, is not at all designed for bananas. For $29.00 you can buy a conversion kit, but that's a crude way to go.There are rumors that the HZ571 can be hacked, but I've had loads of experience with this and can't figure a way to hack this one. I've also heard Hutzler is working on a Verizon Wireless compatible model, but that's completely unconfirmed. A YouTube video of a Verizon version appears to be faked.If you really need a good banana slicer but have Verizon Wireless, you should go ahead and buy. Just be warned that it may not live up to expectations.Full disclosure: I do not own stock in Verizon, AT&T, Amazon, or Hutzler.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

That's what I thought I was getting when my husband and I moved from our home in California to chilly, dim Belmont, Maine. An ideal place to raise the kids -- Josie, 16, and Matthew, 9 -- and friendly neighbors to make every day of our small-town life worth waking up to.Alas. We purchased our spacious new home in optimistic disregard of the warnings of the townsfolk. These small towns! So superstitious! No grizzled old crone with a voice like a rusted iron gate screaming in agony is going to tell ME how to live MY life -- am I right, folks? The house was cheap, and it was exactly what we were looking for. Nothing could go wrong! Well, perhaps the skeletons of small animals we kept finding around the house should have been a clue. Perhaps the weather, which had a tendency to change from bright and sunny to horribly overcast in moments, should have made us think something was up. Perhaps even the sound of screaming in the attic, which yielded only odd scratch marks on the walls when investigated, should have tipped us off. But it didn't.In one of the kitchen drawers of our lovely home we discovered an item which I believe to be a Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. My husband was overjoyed! Finally, a device which perfectly accommodated his banana-slicing needs, apparently left behind by the house's former tenants. Let me tell you, there was a reason it was left behind. Despite my reservations, I agreed to give the banana slicer a shot. It worked very well, and sliced bananas with an efficiency yet unknown to man -- and which I believe should remain unknown.A few weeks after he started using the banana slicer, my husband noticed that he was having trouble sleeping at night. The bedroom grew deathly cold, and the plumbing rattled like it was possessed. My husband complained of terrible dreams, in which giant bananas beckoned to him from the darkest corners of his mind. I begged him to stop using the banana slicer, but he ignored me, insisting it was simply the stress of his new job. I wish I had pursued the matter, but instead I dropped it, agreeing that he was probably right. I was just being silly.When the children began to come to me with marks on their backs and arms in the shape of the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, I knew something had to be done, before it was too late. While my husband was out one day, I threw the banana slicer into the nearby lake. However, due to its plastic composition, it quickly floated back to shore. More serious measures had to be taken. I put the banana slicer into a box, which I then nailed shut, put into another box, shut that box with chains, and buried it in the woods 20 miles from our home. My husband would be none the wiser, I thought, and we would just have to deal with the lack of convenient banana slicing in our lives. However, when I arrived home, there was the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, in my husband's hands. When he asked me where I had been, I couldn't respond. I did not truly know terror until that moment.My terror only increased when my husband began to show signs of hostility, as if the banana slicer was influencing him in some way. He was no longer the nondescript middle-class dark-haired white male I knew. Instead, he snapped at me. He refused to speak to the children. One day, he shoved me. At that point, I knew I had lost him. However, I didn't anticipate what would come next.Months later, my life was hell. I hadn't been sleeping properly. I could hardly eat, with the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer in the kitchen at all times. The children had noticed my lethargy, and seemed afraid to be alone in the house with their father. As it turned out, they were right to be afraid. My husband, influenced by the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, flew into a murderous rage, and would have killed us all had I not stopped him... with the knife I had been using to prepare a butternut squash for dinner.These days, my mother has custody of the children. I have been spending my time recovering -- and hunting for the source of the evil that I now know to be the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer. I've finally found it. Now, its undoing can begin, and I will finally have my life back...::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 3

You see, I... am a slice addict. As you will see, I was among the greatest and most profligate banana slicers in the world. My slicing was legendary. I sliced with John Belushi, Lindsay Lohan, R Kelly, George "Cowboy Banana Cowboy" Bush, Barack "Slicedaddy" Obama, Keith Richards-I once sliced with Chris Farley for 60 hours straight. I was living the high life, until it all came crashing down around me.You see, for years, I was lost in a morass of banana-slicing impotence, aimlessly wandering through life obsessed with finding the perfect banana-slicing instrument. A simple google search yields thousands of competent and admirable banana-slicing products and methods, or b-slizzle as we slice addicts call it, but none measured up to my expectations of banana-slicing grace. I was a substance addict, my tonic being a soft, smooth, perfect banana slice. At first, it was a simple hobby. Like most of you, I would spend no more than five or six hours a day slicing, displaying, posting on facebook, and then consuming. Of course it's probably obvious to most of you now that for those of us with the sliceaholic gene, this level of slicing is not near enough to satiate our desires and can only end up in disaster. But being a true addict, I was blind to the pain I was causing others and deaf to the warnings of friends, family and activists. I ended up hurting those who love me the most: kids, grandkids, wives, parents, and my pet hedgehogs. It got to the point where I would stay awake for days straight pushing my bananas through the strings of my guitar and then shaking them out of the hole or shoving bananas through the chicken wire surrounding my hedgehogs. But the banana slices, magnificent as they were, would inevitably end up getting eaten by the hedgehogs or tasting like guitar. From there I began to explore new and dangerous slice methods-methods that would connect me to both the glamorous side of b-slizzling and the deadly underworld of slice addicts.A typical day for me would begin at the banana factory, trading sex or drugs or cash for a fresh batch of newly-minted bananas. Green, yellow, brown-it mattered not. It was all about the slice for me, as any slice addict can attest. From there I would cruise the whittling district with nothing but a knapsack or barrel full of bananas and a bowie knife, selling my flesh to knife artisans for their crafting of slices. But still, the bananas were sliced only to near-perfection, leaving me craving more and better slice every time. I had already been kicked out of every Japanese restaurant from Houston to Chicago for throwing bananas at the chefs to cut in the air. In my insatiable lust for the smooth sensuality of fresh banana slices, I was blind to the racial insensitivity of this practice. I cannot even begin to count the number of kids around town whose bicycles I stole, just to feed my lust for the reckless and dangerous practice of spoke-slicing, or "splicing" as we call it.As I found newer, more efficient-and often ruthless-slizz techniques, I became more and more careless and violent, but still, it was ever enough. I was arrested at home furnishing stores for pushing thousands of bananas through their window blind displays (blindspotting). I was walking around day and night wearing nothing but multi-blade ice skates just to slice the thousands of bananas littering the floor of my home and yard at any given time (figureslicing). I can't tell you how many poor hedgehogs I killed or maimed because of those shoes. I wasted tens of thousands of dollars on designer grade electric and solar-powered fans with razor-sharp blades to accommodate the immense volume of slicing I was pushing on a daily basis (blowing). I always tried to use solar fans to reduce my carbon footprint.Of course this enslaving lifestyle could not be sustained forever. My picture was on the wall of every Benihana in the southwest. Children all over the state had replaced their traditional spoked wheels with solid spokes, and the motocross bullies would turn their bikes on me and beat me senseless when I would stand alongside the supercross track shoving b into their frenzied wheel-spinning (motoring). On October 3rd, 2007, I had hit rock bottom. I had just slizzed with Sean and Biggie in the Hamptons (he's still alive, turning tricks for b in the banana underworld). I awoke from a potassium coma to find my bank account, formerly over twenty million dollars, completely dry. Everybody talked about the housing and equities markets crashing, but let me tell you, the crisis hit the slicers bad!. My credit cards were all cut off, and my lines of credit with the banks and various banana slicing venture capitalists were dry. And the hedgehogs had revolted in a bloody uprising, known as The Bloody Hedgehog Uprising.As I write to you today, from the comfort of my humble country cottage, I do so giving grace to god, with sorrow and gratitude to those whose lives I crushed and those who stood by me through all the finger cuts and slipping on peels. I have found a tranquil peace, all thanks to the hundreds of amazing, beautiful people who made the H-5 a reality.I will skip the platitudes so pervasive in all the reviews of this magnificent product and cut to the chase. CUT TO THE CHASE. That's what the H-5 does. I call it the H-5 for short and because H-5 sounds almost as awesome as the H-5 is. Who knew that I could find peace from such a complex, yet simple, engineering marvel. You would think that I would have had to walk away cold-turkey, but for me, the game was all about the perfect slice. You see, once you find the perfect slice, your life is at peace. And that is what I have found-what I find every day-the perfect slice. Although my H-5 background check revealed to many illicit banana incidents in the past to procure one legally, I was able to receive a presidential pardon from George Bush because he knows I could blow the whistle on his falsified reports on Saddam's WMB's (Wildly Massive B-Slicers) and from Barack Obama because of the help I offered in getting Obamaslice to the socialists.So kids, understand that banana slicing is not as glamorous as all those billboards in the 70s portrayed it, and can be done in a safe and fun manner from your own home for under five dollars. I sincerely hope that the scientists and board members of Hutzler continue forward and attack similar cancers on humanity like methamphetamines, aids and immigration. So much gratitude goes to Anthony Weiner for bringing bananas into the public eye and to Fox News for having the conviction to doggedly pursue this story in hopes of bringing down the banana-controlled senate. May you all experience the joy and frivolity of the H-571. Peace and love to all.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

Anything that would save me a few extra minutes preparing endless meals would help me hold onto my sanity for just a little longer.  What I didn't count on was how impossible it became to prepare anything else which required individual slicing and cutting one piece at a time.  Suddenly cutting cheese, various fruits and vegetables became so taxing I found myself in tears and desperate for an answer.  I finally caved and started substituting bananas for everything else.  While the solution seemed to fix all my issues the rest of my family did not cope so well.  Instead of appreciating the quickness in which I prepared my daughters grilled banana sandwich I found her heaving in the garbage can.  My husband tells me his employees have lost all respect for him after watching him try to eat ham and banana sandwiches without retching.  And my son, who used to be my "good eater" is wasting away.  I've tried substituting boiled bananas for carrots, which while have always been a favorite of his, are the most time consuming and aggravating vegetables to cut.  But again he expresses his "gratitude" much the same way as my daughter, by retching in the nearest receptacle.  Now I find myself being investigated by child welfare for neglect, and they are running a battery of tests on my family members citing "dangerously high levels of potassium" and "lacking in any other necessary nutrients".  This product, which initially improved my life, has torn my family apart.  I should add however, I don't blame the product I blame my family.

The description does not say so, but the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer, unlike other Hutzler BS models, lacks iPhone integration.Not sure if this was just a design oversight, a deliberate effort by Hutzler to marginalize Apple's profits, or just a reflection of the natural animosity between Apple and Banana.At any rate, after multiple calls to the Hutzler I.T. department went nowhere (high call volume), I came up with my own work-around.  Here's what you need to do:1) Balance the two ends of the 571 Banana Slicer on two soup cans.  (Campbell's "Double Noodle" works best -- Do NOT use Minestrone)2) Place your cereal bowl between the soup cans.3) Place peeled banana on top of the 571 Banana Slicer.  (Banana MUST be pre-peeled.  Will NOT work if you wait to peel it later, per my results on several tries!)4) Place iPhone flush with the 571 over the banana and apply downward pressure, uniformly, keeping the iPhone flat.If you do this correctly, the banana will be forced through the 571 Banana Slicer by the force of the iPhone.  Many of the slices will land in your cereal bowl.  Switch your iPhone to the "spoon" app and enjoy!This work-around makes the 571 usable despite the lack of iPhone integration, but all in all it may be better appreciated by those with smart phones running Android.The 571 is still worth every penny, even for iPhone users, since the technique above will allow you to get perfectly sliced bananas with a lot less pulp sticking in the grooves and buttons than the "old" way of slicing bananas with your iPhone.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

Clients were as rare as hens teeth, these days.  It seemed word got out that I was getting sloppy. "Mr banana fingers", they called me behind my back.  "He's losing his touch", they'ed whisper.  But when you've sliced as many as i have you'd get soft too.  Fat chance I was retiring now. Not with a '57 convertible half way paid off and a tab at the banana stand on 4th that was well past its shelf life. I was a one punch palooka half way to loserville, smelling like cheap cologne and broken dreams.But then she walked in.  She was a knock out.  the kind of girl that made old men suck in their gut and young men puff out their chest.  "We'll hello there sweetheart, the dentist office is next door", I said with a smile."I'm not looking for the dentist", she said.  "I'm looking for Johnny Flynn Private Slicer.""We'll you came to the right place", I said, mustering up what I hoped was a look of confidence.  "Tell me what's on your mind."The story she told would have turned the most jaded slicer green with banana envy.  It was a big job.  The biggest. And even though my gut was turning somersaults I knew I couldn't turn it down.  This was the kind of slicing gig that would make a hundred reputations or destroy a thousand more.Her father was the head of the Dole banana conglomerate and some Ivy League poindexter came up with the big idea to do the annual customer gala with a casino night theme.  But this time they were gunna use banana chips instead of poker chips.  These babies had to be stripped, sliced and dried to exact measurements if they were going to be handled by Dole's biggest clients."I heard you're the best", she said."Was the best", I thought.  "Yeah, I've still got the chops. Watch this. I grabbed my number 7 knife and threw a banana in the air. I swung at it and missed it entirely.  My knife stabbed down through nothin' but air and dropped out of my hand on the table in front of me.  I watched the banana spin slowly as it fell fell fell and slap, like some miracle you read about in those dime store slicer mags, the banana landed on the knife blade and was cut cleanly in two.  My jaw dropped open in amazement and my eyes were big as saucers."Impressive", she said."Impossible", I thought.  "Yep, impressive is my middle name.", I stammered.She tossed her red hair back and said, "You got the job. See you Saturday at eight.""B... Buh... but, we haven't talked about my fee.She laughed and said as she walked to the door, "Whatever your usual fee is, I'll pay triple."Then she added, "Oh, and if you blow this gig you'll never work in this town again."And with a slam of the door she was gone.  I realized then she hadn't told me her name. That didn't matter.  Everyone knew who she was. It was splashed across the society pages every week.  "Dole diva doles out dollars to the down and despondent" or "Lecherous love lorn Lothario leaves Linda Livingston livid".  L. & L. but friends just called her Elle."You'll never work in this town again".Those words echoed over and over in my head.  As I reached for my hat my hand was shaking.  But then, I looked down at the table and saw the miracle banana perfectly sliced.... an accident, or was it?  Maybe the big guy up stairs was gunna save my sorry heiner once again.  I said a quick thanks to my guardian slicer and headed home.  Once I got in bed doubt crashed into my head like a 500 lb gorilla on a sack of Dole's finest.  I wasn't gunna come out of this.  Not ol' Banana Fingers.  I needed help fast and I knew just where to get it.  Johnny Flynns mentor in this business was a crusty old slicer named Harvey Muldoon.  Long retired he learned the trade over seas cooking banana fritters and stew for the yanks during WWI.  If anyone could help me pull this off it was him.  I know it was late but I went over and told him everything--about the dame, the gig and the banana trick.  He sat their stone faced until I told him about the banana flip, miss and slice.  If it wasn't so late in the evening I would swear he shed a tiny tear.  He got up from his chair and stood there. And with a smile he said, "I guess you're going to be needing this."  He dragged the paint chipped chair over to the corner of the room, got up on it.  Reaching up to the ceiling he pushed at a plank which moved out of the way.  He reached into the ceiling compartment and pulled out a box wrapped in an old World War I army issue banana sack.  Inside was a battered tin box.  With a look of immense pride he handed it to me like a father handing someone their new born to hold for the first time.  "This saved my life", he said as he carefully lifted the dented metal lid.  Inside was a hand cut form made of velvet and soft cotton and nestled in the middle was a strange looking device. Reverently he took it out and handed it to me.  "Be careful now.  It's razor sharp.""What is it" I said.It's the Hutzler 571.  It's what gave me the speed and precision to feed thousands of doughboys a day with mess tins and steaming bowls of banana fritters, pudding and stew.I was intrigued but skeptical... until I saw it in action.  Shazam! It sliced bananas faster than Ricky Ricardo could smack a conga drum."I will take good care of it", I said solemnly."You better. It's yours now.", he said.I was overwhelmed. "I don't know what to say.""You can start with a simple thank you" he said with a smirk.Come Saturday I was all ready.  I made a small leather holster for it so that I could pull it out at a moments notice.  I practiced my draw in front of the mirror day and night.  I can't say that the event went perfectly.  But I got the satisfaction of Elle saying I could slice her bananas any old time of the year.I found my confidence that day.  Thanks to some divine help and an old man's secret weapon I made it to the big banana leagues.  No more scraping around for the odd job. Now I named my fee and sliced my way across the banana circuit.  But still, with my fame and banana jet set status Linda Livingston was still out of my league.  Now when I read about her in the society section I save the article and place them in a folder in the large steel safe along with a battered tin box. When I see it I say a quick thanks to her for walking into my life and giving this old flatfoot a chance to start again.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

It is now a firm addition to my pocket inventory.The 571 is basically a rebadge of the classic 491. This is the long awaited B version which adds waterproofing, a 12% more lightweight chassis, sloping stalk ends, and various pro-sumer targeted features. Short of heavy duty models with adjustable spines, this is the most consistent 18er you will find at this size. Period. It scored an 87.6125 slice rate in laboratory testing.My only niggle is that I miss the 'elasti-loc' groove that was found in the late 4 series models. In trouserless situations where utility belts are impractical or frowned upon (IE: in my local indoor swimming pool), I found that with the 571B tucked into my speedos, it did not hold firmly to my hip and I was often having to adjust it back to my side. One time I nearly missed an impromptu BS opportunity when the 571B wasn't in immediate reach. What a panic! Luckily I was directed to its location by the helpful pointing from my fellow pool patrons but this may not always be the case. Yes, it is compatible with the swimwear-attachment housing (v141) to combat this problem but I found that to be cumbersome and detracted from the freestyle nature of this product.It is compatible with the redesigned lanyards, but after the controversy surrounding 'nipplegate', I'm still not comfortable using them.::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

I even invested in a couple bunches of bananas to encourage their new hobby (a waste of money, as we don't eat fruit).  To my disappointment, they couldn't have cared less.  When I inquired about other kids at school who have taken up "nanner slicin'" (probably what the kids are calling it), my sons just laughed at me and replied that slicing bananas is "lame".  I didn't want to throw the bananas away unsliced, so I sliced them all myself- it was quite exhilarating.  But, I specifically purchased this as a means to provide my kids with an extra curricular activity, and maybe turn their grades around and get them off of pot.

I received the box with such glee that I tripped on a brick step and broke my ankle. Turns out the brick was loose because of a safe deposit box key was left under it. After weeks of searching the internet (on wireless, because I had no house), I found the bank the key belonged to. In this bank, a box full of bearer bonds and a small bag of cocaine. I quickly snorted the cocaine and cashed in the bearer bonds. Today, I am a billionaire software developer with an amazing banana slicer that slices bananas pretty well. I recommend this product.

It may change your life, it certainly did mine!Nearly everyone, by now, is well attuned to the difficulties of banana preparation.Specifically the slicing aspect. It gets to the point where looking at a banana (or,heaven forbid, rack of bananas) can fill one with a sense of impending doom. Because you don't want to slice the banana. "Ain't Nobody Got Time For That!" The way I used to handle the situation, was to take a knife and... well... lets just say is was a process. Quite a number of seconds of my life down the drain! For each and every banana! I'm sure there are many who know what I am talking about.Enter the Hutzler 571.The Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer has been a Godsend. Now, instead of the complicated, messy, time consuming (and dangerous) knife-based preparation of my favorite yellow, slightly inappropriately shaped fruit, I can get perfect banana slices in a fraction of the time. I can honestly say this little miracle has shaved seconds off of my slicing time. Thank you Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer for giving me my life back. Now I have plenty of time on my hands to do all those little several-second tasks that have fallen by the wayside. For instance, turning off (and on) the lights, pouring milk and other beverages into a glass, putting on underwear, checking my rear view mirror before backing out, opening (and closing) the drapes, flossing my two lower molars, feeding the puppies, waving back at people, and yes, even the occasional romantic interlude with my wife. The Hutzler 571 has, quite literally, improved virtually every aspect of my life.The build quality of this product is phenomenal. All the intricate working parts are perfectly integrated. The array of slicing mechanisms are perfectly spaced and apparently self aline between uses. The Hutzler 571 is constructed of fine quality plastics and other materials. It looks like a Million Bucks! Visually pleasing to say the least; I would even use the term "Work of Art." If Steve Jobs had devised a banana slicing device this would be it. (Of course the Apple version might be just a tad bit more user friendly... more on that later.) It is beyond me how they can offer the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer at this price point, high as it may be. Perhaps, in the future, they will charge for software updates (I hope not), or upgrades to the OS. Either way, don't be put off by the (seemingly) high cost, this machine is a gem and a bargain at twice the price. It might be tempting to wait and see if the price (currently at $1.29) drops by several percent, to say $1.19 or even $1.09. A substantial savings like that would be nice, but as I've said, I believe the $1.29 price to be more than fair.There IS a steep learning curve with this one. Short, but steep. It took me several days (weeks, actually) to master the techniques necessary to operate this marvel. In fact I could stand to hone my skills further which I plan to do with continuing use. Nevertheless I was (mostly) successfully slicing bananas in under a day of trial and error. Common missteps could have been avoided with an included instructional video. Or such a video, or more appropriately, series of videos, could be sold separately. At any rate, mistakes are unavoidable early on.Reading up on this and other online forums may help. For instance, try to avoid these common (rookie, ha just kidding) mistakes: attempting to slice the banana in an improper orientation (such as lengthwise or "lefthanded"), slicing an unpeeled or partially unpeeled banana (the pealed portion may actually slice, but at the expense of the unpeeled portion), using non-banana fruits (such as watermelons, pumpkins, or plantains), pressing down with zero force, attempting to press the banana through the Hutzler 571 onto the counter, trying to process more than one banana at a time (such as four or six at once), sending the banana through the Hutzler 571 repeated times (in some cased this can work but you have to be extremely accurate), attempting to "turn on" the Hutzler 571 before use (it turns on by itself AND seems to turn off a few minutes after use), slicing the banana with a knife first, and lastly (this got me quite a few times) not pounding the bananas into a smooth pulp with a curtain rod before using the Hutzler 571. I would suggest purchasing eight to ten pounds of bananas to practice on at first, until you get the hang of it. That way when the time comes should you actually need banana slices, you will not be fiddling around unsuccessfully in the heat of the moment (e.g. while your cereal is getting soggy, ice cream is melting or guests are waiting).[Edit: some have said it is possible to process plantains under certain circumstances however my repeated attempts were unsuccessful and I would not recommend it!]In closing, If I had $35.00 for every time the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer got me out of a banana slicing jam I would be a financially better off person right now, I can tell you that! But even without such hypothetical monetary stimulation, my life is fuller due to this wonderful product; and I whole-heartedly recommend the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer to any one with banana slicing needs.Now if they could just invent a device that would enable the easy transfer of butter onto bread (other than the awful knife system I use now!) ... Hutzler 572 perhaps? (Hint, Hint.)::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 4

The color choices on each page is like a work of art. Of all the books this has been the most beautiful to look at, and both I and my son have enjoyed this book for two months now. So why four stars? The flaps are very, very thin. For this kind of a book the construction is of very poor quality and of all the lift-the-flap books my son has, this has been the most poorly made and deserves only one star. However, because I like the images of this book I still give it four stars. But one of the flaps is long gone. I purchased this together with "Dear Zoo" and in comparison between the two books is like night and day. "Dear Zoo" has held up very nicely (also much beloved by my son) because the flaps are made of carton-like paper. But "Where Is Baby's Belly Button" uses thin paper for the flaps. I hope the publishers correct this design flaw. If yes, then I'll very happily purchase it again for future baby #2 :)::entityRecognition for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 0

I also, obviously like that it is a lift the flap book, because they engage my son for so long. One of the reasons I chose this particular book is because it addresses body parts and I thought it would be helpful when learning those body parts.What I don't like:Quality, quality, quality! We own several board books, but this one isn't nearly as nice as many others we own and have seen. He is 19 moths at the time of writing this and we have had it for about 6 months now and it has not held up nearly as well as the other lift the flap books we own, and he plays with this one far less. He loves his books and isn't very rough with them, so this is one of the few books we have that are damaged. The pages are very thin compared to literally every other board book we own, and the flaps are extremely flimsy and got bent during the first use.Overall, we like this book, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different book. It has not been a hit for us and is a bit disappointing. I would have given it 4 stars (maybe 5) if the quality was better.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 0

Eventually between 7-9 months, after reading the reviews here, I ordered this. And voila! He seemed to like it -- well, he would at least sit still on my lap long enough to turn the pages and lift the flaps!  Three months later, it is definitely his favorite book -- he giggles when I pull it out, and loves to lift the flaps up and down, and up and down, and up and down.  After three months of all that upping and downing the flaps ARE raggedy and curled up, but he doesn't seem to mind. I figure on buying it again when it really gets worn.  I would definitely recommend this if you are trying to get a younger, active baby interested in books.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId 9a5176f86197315e for inputIndex 0
