Nobody knows the pain and suffering I have had to indure during these banana slicing quests. I have lost three fingers, a toe, an eye, and a little brother all because this amazing 571 Banana Slicer didn't exist back then! I was hospitalized for suicide, but really I wasn't trying to kill myself I just wanted to eat this delicious fruit in slices.  Trust me buy this product it will not only save you money, but also your limbs, family, and years and years of therapy!  Due to my missing eye and fingers this review took me six days to complete.  Don't make the same mistake as I did and resort to using knives. Now that I have this 571 banana slicer my life is back on the right track, and I can finally sleep at night!::entityRecognition for localAppId bb88f55c7c98a7eb for inputIndex 0

I have wanted a Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer ever since my daughter found the reviews for it on Amazon a few years ago and read them aloud to me while I was driving.  Of course, I nearly ran off the road several times, I was laughing so hard, but we made it safely in the end without getting pulled over.  Although, if we had been, all we would have needed to do was to read a couple reviews to the cop.  I think he would have forgiven us!  Ever since then, I have wanted my very own 571B Banana Slicer--and now I have one!For Christmas brunch, my daughter-in-law asked me to make a fruit salad, and I was so excited to use my new Hutzler 571B Banana Slicer!  I made the salad the night before, but took the intact bananas, my 571B Banana Slicer, and the reviews along so that everyone could enjoy the process.  It was so much FUN slicing my bananas, although I do recommend removing all the stringy things BEFORE you slice.  It's really hard to pick little short sliced-up pieces of stringy stuff off of every slice!I have one suggestion for the Hutzler company:  You need to invent a 571B-B Banana Slicer for those who like thin slices.  These slices are awfully thick, especially for small children.  And trust me, it's REALLY HARD to slice a banana, then have to line the slices up right next to each other, move the Banana Slicer over half a slice--and slice a second time to get nice, thin slices.  You mostly end up with banana pur√©e, which is nice if you're feeding a baby or a really old person, but not so nice for a fancy Christmas fruit salad.One more suggestion for Amazon--MAKE A BOOK OF THE REVIEWS OF THE HUTZLER 571B BANANA SLICER!  I would buy one for every single person in my family--and there are lots of us!I'm attaching photos of me proudly slicing my first banana, as well as the fruit salad with those lovely, perfect little slices of banana.  I foresee a future full of banana cream pies, banana pudding, banana-topped fruit salad, sliced bananas on peanut butter sandwiches, Bananas Foster . . .::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId bb88f55c7c98a7eb for inputIndex 0

I wake up every morning at 5am and stress about getting my morning banana perfectly sliced before I run out to catch the train for my new job downtown.  We have 17 month old twin girls and live in a small house with a ARM mortgage that is about to explode at the end of the month, but that's besides the point.  For years I have struggled to find an easy, safe and practical way of slicing those pesky bananas.  My wife ordered this for me and BAM - I can now wake up refreshed.  We had no idea that cutting banana's for breakfast could take such a toll on my health.  My family physician recommended I stay on my medication, but I think he just wants to collect the money from my insurance company.  I said "No way doc!  I cut bananas with ease and peace of mind - and am going to live my life stress free."  Even on days that I am stuck in traffic for 3-4 hours trying to get to my job that is destined to fail because it's managed by a bunch of crooks that can care less about it's staff, I have my perfectly sliced, slightly brown F#$%#@ bananas!  The best part.  This F#$%# can even slice green bananas.  I got a little over zealous and tried slicing plantain with this, and it was just a little bit too small for that class of fruit.  God speed Hutzler!  You have not only made our breakfast stress free.  You have saved my life.Edit:  I have raised the star level to 5.

After floundering around looking for strategies and materials that will produce smarter, more engaged students with better test scores, we went all in and ordered 20,000 Hutzler 571's so every student and staff member has one for home and school.Before we Hutzlerized our math curriculum, our students tests scores were in the toilet. The revolutionary abacus adaptor kit we developed for the Hutzler allows our students to perform math functions from simple counting for kindergarten,  addition/subtraction for primary; multiplication/division and on through square and cube roots. Algebraic, calculus, etc algothrithms are being developed.When we got our fall math test scores back we were astounded!! Our students are now outperforming the Finnish, Chinese, and Singapore students. It's just unbelievable how excited our students are about their Hutzler math program. They don't even want to use their calculators anymore.We've also totally Hutzlerized our music program. Instruments cost too much money, so now we just use the Hutzler 571 for middle and high school band. Our incredible music teacher has come up with amazing techniques and arrangements for Hutzler kazoo and percussion. Of course, our middle school boys quickly figured out how to use the Hutzler under their armpit to produce additional musical offerings. Our incredible Hutzler concerts move everyone to tears.We are continually discovering new, wonderful uses for the Hutzler 571 in the educational setting. Our school nurses now use the Hutzler as a useful device for checking students for head lice. With a Hutzler in each hand the nurse can pull back the hair and probe the nits with the pointed end. We now have the highest percentage of lice reduction in the state!! Thank you Hutzler!,To conclude, as a 25 year veteran educator, I no longer feel like a dispirited, underpaid, underappreciated grunt. Thanks to the Hutzler 571, my passion for teaching has never been better, and I'm just one of many teachers in our district thinking and dreaming up incredible new lesson plans to incorporate our beloved banana slicers!Hutzler, because of you were no longer a failing school district and we've left no kid behind,::entityRecognition for localAppId bb88f55c7c98a7eb for inputIndex 0

I am flabbergasted by the answer I got. Whilst shopping for life essentials I found this and it was a real blessing. Since I was a 8 year old in Morocco I had two dreams, a banana slicer and a banana straightener. Unfortunately the latter has still not yet been invented. But, lets go to the point of my situation. The banana slicer clearly depicts a Pale Banana PANTONE 12-0824 TPX color, the one I received is a Banana Crepe PANTONE 13-0815 and it is simply unacceptable. No refunds, no explanation, Stacey passed my call to "Rori" (what in the name of bananas is that name?) and he still did not solve issue nor was able to explain why we have this banana tone divergence. Word of caution for you shopper: Pale Banana will not solve your issues. Shipped it back even without a refund.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId bb88f55c7c98a7eb for inputIndex 0

I bought the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer because I could only cut 487 bananas.  Every time I tried to cut the magic 488 bananas the knife would stall out and I would be left with a banana lying on the bottom of the stack, unsliced and mocking.  Then came the Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer.  It seemed too good to be true.  The first time I took it out of its packaging I could hardly contain myself.  I ran to the kitchen, stacked up the entire 571 bananas on the first try, and gave "one quick motion" with my new Hutzler.  But it was a lie!  The Hutzler only went through 220 bananas!  There were still 351 bananas stacked on the counter, unsliced and mocking.  I still feel ashamed.  I really should have known.  Slicing 571 bananas is impossible.I'm still giving it five stars because I bought four of them so the kids could slice their own bananas, and we turned them into excellent snow shoes for our pet wiener dog.::sentimentAnalysis for localAppId bb88f55c7c98a7eb for inputIndex 0
